This\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home\nand community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr\nescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is\npossible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educati",
