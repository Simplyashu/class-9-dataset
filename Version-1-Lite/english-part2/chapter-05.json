The Happy Prince\nThe Happy Prince w as a beautiful statue. He was\ncovered with gold, he had sapphires for eyes, and a\nruby in his sword. Why did he w ant to part with all\nthe gold that he had, and his precious stones?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nThe Happy Prince/ 29\nprepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a lar ge drop of water fell on him. “What a curious thing!”\nhe cried. “Ther e is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars ar e\nquite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.”\nThen another dr op fell.\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain of f ?” he said.\n“I must look for a good chimney pot,” and he deter mined to fly away.\nBut befor e he had opened his wings, a thir d drop fell, and he\nlooked up, and saw — Ah! What did he see?\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince wer e filled with tears, and tears\nwere running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful\nin the moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity.\n“Who ar e you?” he said.\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n“Why ar\ne you weeping then?” asked the swallow. “Y ou have\nquite drenched me.”\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answer ed the\nstatue, “I did not know what tears wer e, for I lived in the Palace,\nwhere sorr ow is not allowed to enter .  My courtiers called me the\nHappy Prince, and happy indeed I was. So I lived, and so I died.\nAnd now that I am dead they have set me up her e so high that I\ncan see the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my\nheart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep.”\n‘What! Is he not solid gold?’ said the swallow to himself. He\nwas too polite to make any personal r emarks.\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far\naway in a little str eet ther e is a poor house. One of the windows is\nopen, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her\nface is thin and wor n, and she has coarse, r ed hands, all pricked\nby the needle, for she is a seamstr ess. She is embr oidering flowers\non a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids of honour ,\nto wear at the next Court ball. In a bed in the cor ner of the r oom\nher little boy is lying ill. He has a fever , and is asking his mother\nto give him oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river\nwater , so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you\nnot bring her the ruby out of my swor d hilt?  My feet ar e fastened\nto this pedestal and I cannot move.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n30 / Moments\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the swallow. “My friends ar e\nflying up and down the Nile, and talking to the lar ge lotus flowers.\nSoon they will go to sleep.”\nThe Prince asked the swallow to stay with him for one night\nand be his messenger . “The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so\nsad,” he said.\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answer ed the swallow. “I want to go\nto Egypt.”\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little swallow was\nsorry. “It is very cold her e,” he said. But he agr eed to stay with\nhim for one night and be his messenger .\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\nThe swallow picked out the gr eat ruby fr om the Prince’s swor d,\nand flew away with it in his beak over the r oofs of the town.\nHe passed by the cathedral tower , wher e the white marble angels\nwere sculptur ed.  He passed by the palace and hear d the sound of\ndancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover .\n“I hope my dr ess will be r eady in time for the State ball,” she\nsaid. “I have or dered flowers to be embr oider ed on it, but the\nseamstr esses ar e so lazy.”\nHe passed over the river , and saw the lanter ns hanging on the\nmasts of the ships. At last he came to the poor woman’s house\nand looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the\nmother had fallen asleep, she was so tir ed. In he hopped, and\nlaid the gr eat ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. Then\nhe flew gently r ound the bed, fanning the boy’s for ehead with his\nwings. “How cool I feel!” said the boy, “I must be getting better;”\nand he sank into a delicious slumber .\nThen the swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him\nwhat he had done. “It is curious,” he r emarked,",
