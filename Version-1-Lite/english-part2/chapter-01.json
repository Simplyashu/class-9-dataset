The Lost Child\nA child goes to a fair with  his parents. He is happy\nand excited and w ants the sweets and toys\ndisplayed there. But his parents don’ t buy them for\nhim. Why then does he refuse  when someone else\noffers them to him?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2 / Moments\n“Come, child, come,” called  his par ents, as he lagged behind,\nfascinated  by the toys in the shops that lined the way.\nHe hurried towar ds his par ents, his feet obedient to their call,\nhis eyes still lingering on the r eceding toys. As he came to wher e\nthey had stopped to wait for him, he could not suppr ess the desir e\nof his heart, even though he well knew the old, cold star e of refusal\nin their eyes.\n“I want that toy,” he pleaded.\nHis father looked at him r ed-eyed, in his familiar tyrant’s way.\nHis mother , melted by the fr ee spirit of the day was tender and,\ngiving him her finger to hold, said, “Look, child, what is befor e you!”\nIt was  a flowering mustar d-field, pale like melting gold as it\nswept acr oss miles and miles of even land.\nA group of dragon-flies wer e bustling about on their gaudy\npurple wings, inter cepting the flight of a lone black bee or butter fly\nin sear ch of sweetness fr om the flowers. The child followed them\nin the air with his gaze, till one of them would still its wings and\nrest, and he would try to catch it. But it would go fluttering,\nflapping, up into the air , when he had almost caught it in his\nhands. Then his mother gave a cautionary call: “Come, child,\ncome, come on to the footpath.”\nHe ran towar ds his par ents gaily and walked abr east of them\nfor a while, being, however , soon left behind, attracted by the\nlittle insects and wor ms along the footpath that wer e teeming out\nfrom their hiding places to enjoy the sunshine.\n“Come, child, come!” his par ents  called fr om the shade  of a\ngrove wher e they had seated themselves on the edge of a well. He\nran towar ds them.\nA shower of young flowers fell upon the child as he enter ed\nthe gr ove, and, for getting his par ents, he began to gather the\nraining petals in his hands. But lo! he hear d the cooing of  doves\nand ran towar ds his par ents, shouting, “The dove! The dove!” The\nraining petals dr opped fr om his for gotten hands.\n“Come, child, come!” they called to the child, who had now\ngone running in wild capers r ound  the banyan tr ee, and  gathering\nhim up they took the narr ow, winding footpath which led to the\nfair thr\nough the mustar d fields.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nThe Lost Child / 3\nAs they near ed the village the child could see many other\nfootpaths full of thr ongs, conver ging to the whirlpool of the fair ,\nand felt at once r epelled and fascinated by the confusion of the\nworld he was entering.\nA sweetmeat seller hawked, “ gulab-jaman, rasagulla, bur fi,\njalebi ,” at the cor ner of the entrance and a cr owd pr essed r ound\nhis counter at the foot of an ar chitectur e of many colour ed  sweets,\ndecorated with leaves of silver and gold. The child star ed open-\neyed and his mouth water ed for the burfi that was his favourite\nsweet. “I want that burfi,”  he slowly mur mured. But he half knew\nas he begged that his plea would not be heeded because his\nparents would say he was gr eedy. So without waiting for an answer\nhe moved on.\nA flower -seller hawked, “A garland of gulmohur , a garland of\ngulmohur !” The child seemed irr esistibly drawn. He went towar ds\nthe basket wher e the flowers lay heaped and half mur mured, “I\nwant that garland.” But he well knew his par ents would r efuse to\nbuy him those flowers because they would say that they wer e\ncheap. So, without waiting for an answer , he moved on.\nA man stood holding a pole with yellow, r ed, gr een and purple\nballoons flying fr om it. The child was simply carried away by the\nrainbow glory of their silken colours and he was filled with an\noverwhelming desir e to possess them all. But he well knew his\nparents would never buy him the balloons because they would\nsay he was too old to play with such toys. So he walked on farther .\nA snake-char mer stood playing a flute to a snake which coiled\nitself in a basket, its head raised in a graceful bend like the neck\nof a swan, while the music stole into its invisible ears like the\ngentle rippling of an invisible water fall. The child went towar ds\nthe snake-char mer. But, knowing his par ents had forbidden him\nto hear such coarse music as the snake-char mer played, he\nproceeded farther .\nThere was a r oundabout in full swing. Men, women and\nchildr en, carried away in a whirling motion, shrieked and cried\nwith dizzy laughter . The child watched them intently and then he\nmade a bold r equest: “I want to go on the r oundabout, please,",
