Geometry appears to have originated from\nthe need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various\nforms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece,\nthe Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems\nwhich required the development of geometry in various ways.\nFor example, whenever the river Nile\noverflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between\nthe adjoining fields of dif ferent land owners. After\nsuch flooding, these boundaries had to be\nredrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians\ndeveloped a number of geometric techniques and\nrules for calculating simple areas and also for\ndoing simple constructions. The knowledge of\ngeometry was also used by them for computing\nvolumes of granaries, and for constructing canals\nand pyramids. They also knew the correct formula\nto find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see\nFig. 5.1).Y ou know that a pyramid is a solid figure,\nthe base of which is a triangle, or square, or some\nother polygon, and its side faces are triangles\nconverging to a point at the top.Fig. 5.1 :  A Truncated Pyramid\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 61\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, etc.\nshow that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 BCE) made extensive use of\ngeometry . It was a highly or ganised society . The cities were highly developed and\nvery well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was\nan underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This\nshows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic.\nThe bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness,\nof the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1.\nIn ancient India, the Sulbasutras  (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of\ngeometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the\nconstruction of altars (or vedis ) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location\nof the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about\ntheir shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular\naltars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations\nof rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra\n(given in the Atharvaveda ) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These\ntriangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though\naccurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles\nbehind them were not discussed.\nThese examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere\nin the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner . What is interesting\nabout these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed\non from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by\nother ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained\na very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry\ndeveloped by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no\ngeneral rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry\nmostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science.\nBut in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning  behind why certain\nconstructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the\nstatements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1).\nA Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the\nfirst known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle\nis bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter . One of\nThales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom\nyou have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many\ngeometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a\ngreat extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time\nEuclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected\nall the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise,Thales\n(640 BCE – 546 BCE)\nFig. 5.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n62 MATHEMA TICS\ncalled ‘Elements’. He divided the ‘Elements’ into thirteen\nchapters, each called a book. These books influenced\nthe whole world’ s understanding of geometry for\ngenerations to come.\nIn this chapter , we shall discuss Euclid’ s approach\nto geometry and shall try to link it with the present day\ngeometry .\n5.2 Euclid’ s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates\nThe Greek mathematicians of Euclid’ s time thought of geometry as an abstract model\nof the w",
