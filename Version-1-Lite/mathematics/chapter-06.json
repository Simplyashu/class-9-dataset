You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you\nproved some other statements. In this chapter , you will study the properties of the\nangles formed when two lines intersect each other , and also the properties of the\nangles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.\nFurther you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning\n(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities\nin the earlier classes.\nIn your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of\nplane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need\nto have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a\nmodel of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you\nwould make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other , and some\nsticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried\nbuilding, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at dif ferent angles. Without\nthe knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw\nthe layout of the building?\nIn science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.\nFor example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium\nto the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.\nWhen two or more forces act on a body , you draw the diagram in which forces are\nrepresented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the\nbody . At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays\n(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other . To find the height of a tower\nor to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n70 MATHEMA TICS\nformed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be\ngiven where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry , you\nwill be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful\nproperties.\nLet us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in\nearlier classes.\n6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions\nRecall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment\nand a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is\ndenoted by AB, and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002, and\na line is denoted by AB\u0003\u0001\u0001\u0002. However , we will not use these symbols , and will denote\nthe line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The\nmeaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be\nused to denote lines.\nIf three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points ;\notherwise they are called non-collinear points .\nRecall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\nThe rays making an angle are called the arms  of the angle and the end point is called\nthe vertex of the angle. You have studied dif ferent types of angles, such as acute\nangle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes\n(see Fig. 6.1).\n(i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90° (ii) right angle : y = 90° (iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180°\n(iv) straight angle : s = 180° (v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360°\nFig. 6.1 : Types of Angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nLINES AND ANGLES 71\nAn acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right  angle is exactly\nequal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle .\nAlso, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180°\nbut less than 360° is called a reflex angle . Further , two angles whose sum is 90° are\ncalled complementary angles , and two angles whose sum is 180° are called\nsupplementary angles .\nYou have also studied about adjacent angles\nin the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles\nare adjacent , if they have a common vertex, a\ncommon arm and their non-common arms are\non different sides of the common arm. In\nFig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent\nangles. Ray BD is their common arm and point\nB is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC\nare non common arms. Moreover , when two\nangles are adjacent, then their sum is always\nequal to the angle formed by the two non-\ncommon arms. So, we can write\n∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC.\nNote that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not\nadjacent angles. Why? Because their non-\ncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side\nof the common arm BA.\nIf the non-common arms BA and BC in\nFig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.\nIn this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are calle",
