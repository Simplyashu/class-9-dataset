You also know how\nto describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which\nto find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one\nline. For example, consider the following situations:\nI. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running\nin the East-W est direction and streets with\nnumbering from West to East. Also, on each\nstreet, house numbers are marked. To look for\na friend’ s house here, is it enough to know only\none reference point? For instance, if we only\nknow that she lives on Street 2, will we be able\nto find her house easily? Not as easily as when\nwe know two pieces of information about it,\nnamely , the number of the street on which it is\nsituated, and the house number . If we want to\nreach the house which is situated in the 2nd\nstreet and has the number 5, first of all we\nwould identify the 2nd street and then the house\nnumbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the\nlocation of the house. Similarly , P shows the\nlocation of the house corresponding to Street\nnumber 7 and House number 4.Fig. 3.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n44 MATHEMA TICS\nII. Suppose you put a dot on a sheet of paper [Fig.3.2 (a)]. If we ask you to tell us\nthe position of the dot on the paper , how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some\nsuch manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of\nthe paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of\nthese statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is\nnearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still\ndoes not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot\nis also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is!\nFig. 3.2\nFor this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two\nfixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In\nother words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot.\nNow , perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’.\nActivity 1 (Seating Plan) :  Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all\nthe desks together . Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name\nof the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each\nstudent in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations:\n(i)the column in which she or he sits,\n(ii)the row in which she or he sits.\nIf you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by\nthe shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the\ncolumn number , and then the row number . Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the\nnames and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in\nthe 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher ’s desk is not part of your seating\nplan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nCOORDINA TE GEOMETR Y 45\nFig. 3.3\nIn the discussion above, you observe that position of any object lying in a plane\ncan be represented with the help of two perpendicular lines. In case of ‘dot’, we\nrequire distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper . In\ncase of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row . This\nsimple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important\nbranch of Mathematics known as Coor dinate Geometr y. In this chapter , we aim to\nintroduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry . You will study more about\nthese in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher\nand mathematician René Déscartes .\nRené Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the\nseventeenth century , liked to lie in bed and think! One\nday, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane. His method\nwas a development of the older idea of latitude and\nlongitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane is also\nknown as the Cartesian system.\nEXERCISE 3.1\n1.How will you describe the position of a table lamp on your study table to another\nperson?\n2.(Street Plan) :  A city has two main roads which cross each other at the centre of the\ncity. These two roads are along the North-South direction and East-W est direction.René Déscartes (1596 -1650)\nFig. 3.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n46 MATHEMA TICS\nAll the ",
