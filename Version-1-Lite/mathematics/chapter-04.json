Can you write\ndown a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + 2 = 0 and\n2y + 3 = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that\nsuch equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember\nhow to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter , the knowledge of linear\nequations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You\nwill be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a\nsolution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane?\nYou shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions.\n4.2 Linear Equations\nLet us first recall what you have studied so far . Consider the following equation:\n2x + 5 = 0\nIts solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is 5\n2−. This can be represented on the\nnumber line as shown below:\nFig. 4.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n56 MATHEMA TICS\nWhile solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind:\nThe solution of a linear equation is not affected when:\n(i)the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation.\n(ii)you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero\nnumber .\nLet us now consider the following situation:\nIn a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in\nNagpur , two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the\nform of an equation.\nHere, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two\nunknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored\nby one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know\nthat\nx + y =176,\nwhich is the required equation.\nThis is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote\nthe variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some\nexamples of linear equations in two variables are:\n1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q =7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = 2x – 7y.\nNote that you can put these equations in the form 1.2 s + 3 t – 5 = 0,\np + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and 2x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively .\nSo, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c\nare real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two\nvariables . This means that you can think of many many such equations.\nExample 1 :  Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and\nindicate the values of a, b and c in each case:\n(i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 (ii) x – 4 = 3y (iii) 4 = 5 x – 3y (iv) 2 x = y\nSolution :  (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2 x + 3y – 4.37 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3\nand c = – 4.37.\n(ii) The equation x – 4 = 3y can be written as x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 1,\nb = – 3 and c = – 4.\n(iii) The equation 4 = 5 x – 3y can be written as 5 x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 5, b = –3\nand c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5 x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this\ncase a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nLINEAR  EQUA TIONS  IN TWO VARIABLES 57\n(iv) The equation 2 x = y can be written as 2 x – y + 0 = 0. Here a = 2, b = –1 and\nc = 0.\nEquations of the type ax + b = 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables\nbecause they can be expressed as\nax + 0. y + b =0\nFor example, 4 – 3 x = 0 can be written as –3 x + 0.y + 4 = 0.\nExample 2 :  Write each of the following as an equation in two variables:\n(i) x = –5 (ii) y = 2 (iii) 2 x = 3 (iv) 5 y = 2\nSolution :  (i) x = –5 can be written as 1. x + 0. y = –5, or 1. x + 0.y + 5 = 0.\n(ii) y = 2 can be written as 0. x + 1.y = 2, or0.x + 1.y – 2 = 0.\n(iii) 2 x = 3 can be written as 2 x + 0.y – 3 = 0.\n(iv) 5 y = 2 can be written as 0. x + 5y – 2 = 0.\nEXERCISE 4.1\n1.The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen. Write a linear equation in two\nvariables to represent this statement.\n(Take the cost of a notebook to be ` x and that of a pen to be ` y).\n2.Express the following linear equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the\nvalues of a, b and c in each case:\n(i)2x + 3y = 9.35 (ii)x – 5y – 10 = 0 (iii)–2x + 3y = 6 (iv)x = 3y\n(v)2x = –5 y (vi)3x + 2 = 0 (vii) y – 2 = 0 (viii) 5 = 2x\n4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation\nYou have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution. What\ncan you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there\nare two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one\nfor y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2 x + 3y = 12.\nHere, x =",
