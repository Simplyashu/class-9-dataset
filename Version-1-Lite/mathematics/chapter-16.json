This principle marks a departure\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\na gap between the school, home and community . The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also\nattempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject areas.
