India\nbeing a vast country you can imagine the\ntypes of bio -forms available throughout the\ncountry.\nOur country India is one of the 12 mega\nbio-diversity countries of the  world. With\nabout 47,000 plant species India occupies\ntenth place in the world and fourth in Asia in\nplant diversity. There are about  15,000\nflowering plants in India , which account for\n6 per cent in the world’s total number of\nflowering plants. The country has many non-\nflowering plants , such as ferns, algae and\nfungi. India also has approximately 90 ,000\nspecies of animals , as well as , a rich variety of\nfish in its fresh and marine waters.\nNatural vegetation refers to a plant\ncommunity, which has grown naturally\nwithout human aid and has been left\nundisturbed by humans for a long time. This\nis termed as a virgin vegetation . Thus,\ncultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part\nof vegetation but not natural vegetation.NATURAL VEGET ATION AND WILDLIFE\nTYPES OF VEGETATION\nThe following major types of vegetation may\nbe identified in our country (Figure 5.4).\n(i)T\nropical Ever green For ests\n(ii)Tropical Deciduous For ests\n(iii)Tropical Thor n For ests and Scrubs\n(iv)Montane Forests\n(v)Mangrove Forests5\nThe virgin vegetation, which\nare purely Indian are known as endemic or\nindigenous species but those which have come\nfrom outside India are termed as exotic plants.\n The term flora  is used to denote plants of\na particular region or period. Similarly, the\nspecies of animals are referred to as fauna .\n Figure 5.1 : Tropical Evergreen Forest\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n40 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-ITropical Ever green For ests\nThese forests are restricted to heavy rainfall\nareas of the W estern Ghats and the island\ngroups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and\nNicobar , upper parts of Assam and T amil Nadu\ncoast. They are at their best in areas having\nmore than 200 cm of rainfall with a short dry\nseason. The trees reach great heights up  to 60\nmetres or even above. Since the region is warm\nand wet thr oughout the year , it has a luxuriant\nvegetation of all kinds — trees, shrubs and\ncreepers giving it a multilayered structure. There\nis no definite time for trees to shed their leaves.\nAs such , these forests appear green all the\nyear round.\nSome of the commercially important trees\nof this forest are ebony, mahogany, rosewood,\nrubber and cinchona.\nThe common animals found in these forests\nare elephant, monkey, lemur and deer . One-\nhorned rhinoceroses are found in the jungles\nof Assam and W est Bengal. Besides these\nanimals, plenty of birds, bats, sloth, scorpions\nand snails are also found in these jungles.\nTropical Deciduous For ests\nThese are the most widespread forests of India.\nThey are also called the monsoon forests and\nspread over the region receiving rainfall\nbetween 200 cm and 70 cm. T rees of this for esttype shed their leaves for about six to eight\nweeks in dry summer .\nOn the basis of the availability of water ,\nthese forests are further divided into moist and\ndry deciduous. The former is found in areas\nreceiving rainfall between 200 and 100 cm.\nThese forests exist, therefore, mostly in the\neastern part of the country — northeastern\nstates, along the foothills of the Himalayas,\nJharkhand, W est Odisha and Chhattisgar h,\nand on the easter n slopes of the W estern Ghats.\nTeak is the most dominant species of this forest.\nBamboos , sal, shisham, sandalwood\n, khair ,\nkusum, arjun and mulberry  are other\ncommercially important species.\nThe dry deciduous forests are found in areas\nhaving rainfall between 100 cm and 70  cm.\nThese forests are found in the rainier parts of\nthe Peninsular plateau and the plains of Bihar\nand Uttar Pradesh. There are open stretches,\nin which teak, sal, peepal and neem  grow. A\nlarge part of this region has been cleared for\ncultivation and some parts are used for grazing.\nIn these forests, the common animals found\nare lion, tiger , pig, deer and elephant. A huge\nvariety of birds, lizards, snakes and tortoises\nare also found here.\nThe Thorn Forests and Scrubs\nIn regions with less than 70 cm of rainfall, the\nnatural vegetation consists of thorny trees and\nFigure 5.2 : Tropical Deciduous Forest\n Figure 5.3 : Thorn Forests and Scrubs\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nNATURAL VEGET ATION AND WILDLIFE 41Study the given map for the forest cover and try to find the reasons as to why certain states have more forest area\nas compared to others?Figur e 5.4 : Natural V egetation\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n42 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-Ibushes. This type of vegetation is found in the\nnorth-western part of the country, including\nsemi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and\nHaryana.
