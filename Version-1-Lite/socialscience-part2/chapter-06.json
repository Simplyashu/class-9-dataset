Who would have utilised\nthe resources and created social and\ncultural environment? The people are\nimportant to develop the economy and the\nsociety. The people make and use resources\nand are themselves resources with varying\nquality.  Coal is but a piece of rock, until people\nwere able to invent technology to obtain it and\nmake it ‘resource’. Natural events, like a flood\nor a Tsunami, becomes a ‘disaster’ only when\nthey affect a crowded village or a town.\nHence, population is the pivotal element in\nsocial studies. It is the point of reference from\nwhich all other elements are observed and from\nwhich they derive significance and meaning.\n‘Resources’, ‘calamities’ and ‘disasters’ are all\nmeaningful only in relation to human beings.\nTheir numbers, distribution, growth and\ncharacteristics or qualities provide the basic\nbackground for understanding and\nappreciating all aspects of the environment.\nHuman beings are producers and\nconsumers of earth’s resources. Therefore, it\nis important to know how many people are\nthere in a country, where do they live, how and\nwhy their numbers are increasing and what\nare their characteristics.  The census of India\nprovides us with information regarding the\npopulation of our country.POPULATION  SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION\nIndia’s Population Size and Distribution\nby Numbers\nIndia’s population as on March 2011 stood at\n1,210.6 million, which account for more the\n17 per cent of the world’s population. These\n1.21 billion people are unevenly distributed\nover our country’s vast area of 3.28 million\nsquare km, which accounts for 2.4 per cent of\nthe world’s area (Figure 6.1).\nThe 2011 Census data reveal that  Uttar\nPradesh with a population size of 199 million\nis the most populous state of India.  Uttar\nPradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of the\ncountry’s population.  On the other hand, the\nHimalayan state of Sikkim has a population of\njust about 0.6 million and Lakshadweep has\nonly 64,429 people.\nAlmost half of India’s population lives in\njust five states. These are Uttar Pradesh,\nMaharashtra, Bihar , West Bengal and Andhra\nPradesh. Rajasthan, the biggest state  in terms\nof area, has only 5.5 per cent of the total\npopulation of India (Figure 6.2)\n  • What could be the reason\nof uneven distribution of population in India?\nCensus\nA census is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India, the first census was held in the year\n1872. The first complete census, however , was taken in the year 1881. Since then, censuses have been held\nregularly every tenth year .\nThe Indian Census is the most comprehensive source of demographic, social and economic data. Have you\never seen a census report? Check in your library if it has one.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nPOPULATION 49India’s Population Distribution by Density\nPopulation density provides a better picture\nof the uneven distribution. Population density\nis calculated as the number of persons per unit\narea. India is one of the most densely populated\ncountries of the world.\nIndia,17.5%Restoftheworld,82.5%\nRestoftheworld,97.6%\nIndia,2.4%AREAPOPULATION\nFig 6.1 : India’s Shar e of W orld’s Ar ea and Population\nFig. 6.2: Distribution of Population\nSource: Census of India, 2011Do You KnowOnly Bangladesh and Japan have\nhigher average population densities\nthan India. Find out the population\ndensities of Bangladesh and Japan.\nThe population density of India in the year\n2011 was 382 persons per sq km. Densities\nvary from 1,102 persons per sq km in Bihar to\nonly 17 persons per sq km in Arunachal\nPradesh. A study of the Figure 6.3 shows the\npattern of uneven distribution of population\ndensities at the State level.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n50 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-INote: Telangana became the 29th State of India in June 2014.\n* State of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories namely Jammu and\nKashmir and Ladakh on 05.08.19.\nFig. 6.3: Density of Population (Census of India 2011)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nPOPULATION 512 per cent per annum means that in a given\nyear, ther e was an incr\nease of two persons for\nevery 100 persons in the base population.
