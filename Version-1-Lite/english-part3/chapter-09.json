Under the sanctuary of his aviators, his eyes silently scanned the room. He is a Manhattan-based, third-generation private detective who’s been in the business for more than three decades — specialising in surveillance and being an overall mystery-tinged badass. We asked him everything we’ve ever wanted to know about the profession.\nUnit 9.indd   124 20-02-2023   09:29:55\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nUnit 9125\nNotesInterviewer  : So, what exactly do you do?\nDetective  : I do a lot of surveillance. Basically, \nsomeone who wonders, “What is this other \nperson up to?” If it’s insurance \ncompany (surveying someone on workers’ compensation), they’ll ask, “Is he back working?” Things like that.\n  Another very common request is locating people, and it could be for \na lot \nof reasons. I had a case recently, a man hadn’t been in touch with his mother for 20 years and I helped him find her.\nInterviewer\n : What kind of skills make for a good PI (Private Investigator)?\nDetective\n : Patience  — Number one. You have to \npay attention. You have to be the kind of person, if you sit in front of a door watching it for six hours, and you haven’t seen your guy.\n  You have to plan accordingly, and be willing to make sacrifices \nin order to stay \nout there. It’s not a job for people who want to slack off.\nInterviewer\n : If you needed to locate someone, what’s \nthe ideal information you need to start?\nDetective  : Usually, this is what I tell people, “If you want \nto find someone, I need the name \nwith the exact spelling, the DOB if you know it, the social security number, and a last known, official address where they’ve lived within the past 15 years.” Because that means they’ll be in our database.\nInterviewer\n : Do most private investigators \nhave a \nrelationship with local police? \nDetective  : I would say that’s kind of a myth. Most cops wouldn’t even do \nit in the first \nplace, because they know how serious a violation it is.\nInterviewer\n : Do most private eyes carry guns?\nDetective  : I don’t think so. We don’t kill people but help them.surveillance:  close \nobservation, especially of a \nsuspected spy or criminal\nDOB: Date of Birth\nUnit 9.indd   125 20-02-2023   09:29:55\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n Words and ExprEssions  1126Interviewer  : What do films and television shows get \nwrong about being a PI?\nDetective  : The big difference is, the things you see \nin \nfilms do happen to private detectives, \nbut they’re shrinking down maybe 20 \nyears of adventure into an episode. After 30 years, I probably have one good movie worth of experiences.\n(Adapted from https://www.thrillist.com/.../private-detective-interview-\nquestions-you-ve-always-want) \n1.
