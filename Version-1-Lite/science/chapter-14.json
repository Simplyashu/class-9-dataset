This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape\nour system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The\nsyllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-\ncentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom.
