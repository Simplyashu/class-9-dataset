The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.

Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required\nnumber of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.  The methods\nused for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\nbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,\nrather than a source of stress or boredom.
