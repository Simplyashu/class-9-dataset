You know that this list\ngoes on for ever . (Why is this true?) So, now your\nbag contains infinitely many natural numbers! Recall\nthat we denote this collection by the symbol N.\nNow turn and walk all the way back, pick up\nzero and put it into the bag. You now have the\ncollection of whole numbers which is denoted by\nthe symbol W.\nNow , stretching in front of you are many , many negative integers. Put all the\nnegative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the\ncollection of all integers , and it is denoted by the symbol Z.\nAre there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like\n1 3,\n2 4, or even 2005\n2006−. If you put all such numbers also into the bag, it will now be theZ comes from the\nGerman word\n“zahlen”, which means\n“to coun t”.\nQ\n–6721\n121\n3\n–1\n981\n161\n420052006–12\n139\n14–6625\n-65\n601919\n9990–6727 58\n200\n52006\n3\n–516\n60999\n4\n–8–662558\n0\n277117\n981\n–12\n13\n89–6\n7\n2\n39\n14–Why Z ?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 3\ncollection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q.\n‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.\nYou may recall the definition of rational numbers:\nA number ‘ r’ is called a rational number , if it can be written in the form p\nq,\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?)\nNotice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 25;1− here p = –25\nand q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole\nnumbers and integers.\nYou also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in\nthe form p\nq, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1\n2 = 2\n4 = 10\n20 = 25\n50\n= 47\n94, and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions ). However ,\nwhen we say that p\nq is a rational number , or when we represent p\nq on the number\nline, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that  p and q have no common factors other than 1\n(that is, p and q are co-prime ). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many\nfractions equivalent to 1\n2, we will choose 1\n2 to represent all of them.\nNow , let us solve some examples about the dif ferent types of numbers, which you\nhave studied in earlier classes.\nExample 1 :  Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)Every whole number is a natural number .\n(ii)Every integer is a rational number .\n(iii)Every rational number is an integer .\nSolution :  (i)False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number .\n(ii)True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1m, and so it is a\nrational number .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n4 MATHEMA TICS\n(iii)False, because 3\n5 is not an integer .\nExample 2 :  Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2.\nWe can approach this problem in at least two ways.\nSolution 1 :  Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and\ns and divide the sum by 2, that is 2r s+ lies between r and s. So, 3\n2 is a number\nbetween 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13 7. , , and4 8 8 4\nSolution 2 :  The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since\nwe want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1,\ni.e., 1 = 6\n6 and 2 = 12\n6. Then you can check that 7\n6, 8\n6, 9\n6, 10\n6 and 11\n6 are all rational\nnumbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5 11,, , and6 3 2 3 6.\nRemark :  Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many\nrational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational\nnumbers between any two given rational numbers .\nLet us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?\nNot, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number\nline! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just\none or two but infinitely many . The amazing thing is that there are infinitely",
