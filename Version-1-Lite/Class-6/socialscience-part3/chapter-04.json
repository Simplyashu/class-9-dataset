Food security depends on the\nPublic Distribution System (PDS) and\ngovernment vigilance and action at\ntimes, when this security is threatened.\nWhat is food security?\nFood is as essential for living as air is for\nbreathing. But food security means\nsomething more than getting two square\nmeals. Food security has following\ndimensions\n(a)availability of food  means food\nproduction within the country, food\nimports and the previous years stock\nstored in government granaries.\n(b)accessibility  means food is within reach\nof every person.\n(c)affordability implies that an individual\nhas enough money to buy sufficient,\nsafe and nutritious food to meet one's\ndietary needs.\nThus, food security is ensured in a\ncountry only if (1) enough food is available\nfor all the persons (2) all persons have\nthe capacity to buy food of acceptable\nquality and (3) there is no barrier on\naccess to food.\nWhy food security?\nThe poorest section of the society might\nbe food insecure most of the times while\npersons above the poverty line might also\nbe food insecure when the country facesFood Security in India Chapter4\nFood Security in India\na national disaster/calamity like\nearthquake, drought, flood, tsunami,\nwidespread failure of crops causing\nfamine, etc. How is food security\naffected during a  calamity?  Due to a\nnatural calamity, say drought, total\nproduction of foodgrains decreases. It\ncreates a shortage of food in the affected\nareas. Due to shortage of food, the prices\ngoes up. At the high prices, some people\ncannot afford to buy food. If such calamity\nhappens in a very wide spread area or is\nstretched over a longer time period, it\nmay cause a situation of starvation.\nA massive starvation might take a turn\nof famine.\nA Famine is characterised by wide\nspread deaths due to starvation an dIn the 1970s, food security was\nunderstood as the “availability at all times\nof adequate supply of basic foodstuffs”\n(UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new\ndimension to food security and\nemphasised the “access” to food through\nwhat he called ‘entitlements’ — a\ncombination of what one can produce,\nexchange in the market alongwith state\nor other socially provided supplies.\nAccordingly, there has been a substantial\nshift in the understanding of food security.\nThe 1995 W orld F ood Summit declared,\n“Food security at the individual,\nhousehold, regional, national and global\nlevels exists when all people, at all times,\nhave physical and economic access to\nsufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet\ntheir dietary needs and food preferences\nfor an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996,\np.3). The declaration further recognises\nthat “poverty eradication is essential to\nimprove access to food”.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nFood Security in India  \n   43\nPicture 4.2 During the Bengal Famine of\n1943, a family leaves its village\nin Chittagong district in Bengal.Picture 4.1  Starvation victims arriving at a\nrelief centre, 1945.  Let’ s Discuss\n1.Some people say that the Bengal famine happened because there was a shortage\nof rice. Study the table and find out whether you agree with the statement?\n2.Which year shows a drastic decline in food availability?Do you know who were affected the\nmost  by the famine?  The agricultural\nlabourers, fishermen, transport\nworkers and other casual labourers\nwere affected the most by dramatically\nincreasing price of rice.

It is, however ,\ndisturbing to note that even today, famine\nlike conditions exist in many parts of the\ncountry, leading to starvation deaths at\ntimes.
