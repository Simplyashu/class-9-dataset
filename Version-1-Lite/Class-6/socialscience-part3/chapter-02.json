Looking at the\npopulation from this productive aspect\nemphasises its ability to contribute to\nthe creation of the Gross National\nProduct. Like other resources population\nalso is a resource — a 'hum an resource '.\nThis is the positive side of a large\npopulation that is often overlooked when\nwe look only at the negative side,\nconsidering only the problems of\nproviding the population with food,\neducation and access to health facilities.\nWhen the existing 'human resource ' is\nfurther developed by becoming more\neducated and healthy, we call it 'human\ncapital formation ' that adds to the\nproductive power of the country just like\n'physical capital formation '.\nInvestment in human capital\n(through education, training, medical\ncare) yields a return just like investment\nin physical capital. This can be seen\ndirectly in the form of higher incomes\nearned because of higher productivity\nof the more educated or the better trained\npersons, as well as the higher\nproductivity of healthier people.People as Resource2\nChapter\nIndia’s Green Revolution is a\ndramatic example of how the input\nof greater knowledge in the form of\nimproved production technologies can\nrapidly increase the productivity of\nscarce land resources. India’s IT\nrevolution is a striking instance of\nhow the importance of human capital\nhas come to acquire a higher position\nthan that of material, plant and\nmachinery.\nSource : Planning Commission, Govt. of India.People as Resource2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nPeople as Resource  \n  17\nNot only do the more educated and the\nhealthier people gain through higher\nincomes, society also  gains  in other\nindirect ways because the advantages of a\nmore educated or a healthier population\nspreads to those also who themselves were\nnot directly educated or given health care.\nIn fact, human capital is in one way\nsuperior to other resources like land and\nphysical capital: human resource can\nmake use of land and capital. Land and\ncapital cannot become useful on its own!\nFor many decades in India, a large\npopulation has been considered a liability\nrather than an asset. But a largeLet’s Discuss\n•Looking at the photograph can you\nexplain how a doctor , teacher , engine er\nand a tailor are an asset to the\neconomy?population need not be a burden for the\neconomy. It can be turned into a\nproductive asset by investment in human\ncapital (for example, by spending\nresources on education and health for all,\ntraining of industrial and agricultural\nworkers in the use of modern technology,\nuseful scientific researches and so on).\nThe two following cases illustrate how\npeople can try to become a more productive\nresource:\nStory of Sakal\nThere were two friends Vilas and\nSakal living in the same village\nSemapur . Sakal was a twelve-year -\nold boy. His mother Sheela looked\nafter domestic chores. His father Buta\nChaudhary worked in an agricultural\nfield. Sakal helped his mother in\ndomestic chores. He also looked after\nhis younger brother Jeetu and sister\nSeetu. His uncle Shyam had passed\nthe matriculation examination, but,\nwas sitting idle in the house as he\nhad no job. Buta and Sheela were\neager to teach Sakal. They forced him\nto join the village school which he\nsoon joined. He started studying and\ncompleted his higher secondary\nexamination. His father persuaded\nhim to continue his studies. He raised\na loan for Sakal to study a vocational\ncourse in computers. Sakal was\nmeritorious and interested in studies\nfrom the beginning. With great vigour\nand enthusiasm he completed his\ncourse. After some time he got a job\nin a private firm. He even designed a\nnew kind of software. This software\nhelped him increase the sale of the\nfirm. His boss acknowledged his\nservices and rewarded him with a\npromotion.Picture 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n18   \n   Economics\nStory of Vilas\nVilas was an eleven-year old boy\nresiding in the same village as Sakal.\nVilas’s father Mahesh was a\nfisherman. His father passed away\nwhen he was only two years old. His\nmother Geeta sold fish to earn money\nto feed the family. She bought fish\nfrom the landowner’s pond and sold\nit in the nearby mandi . She could\nearn only Rs 150 a day by selling fish.\nVilas became a patient of arthritis.\nHis mother could not afford to take\nhim to the doctor . He could not go to\nschool either . He was not interested\nin studies. He helped his mother in\ncooking and also looked after his\nyounger brother Mohan. After some\ntime his mother fell sick and there\nwas no one to lo ok after her .
