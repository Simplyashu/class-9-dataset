They have to work\nwith and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such\ninstitutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the\nmanner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our\ncountry. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are\nresolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key\nrole in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary.\nYou have already read something about these institutions in earlier\nclasses. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking\nlarger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this\ninstitution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?\nWhat makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective\nhere is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the\nwork of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions\nin other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the\nworking of the national level government called Central Government, Union\nGovernment, or just Government of India. While reading this chapter, you\ncan think of and discuss examples from the working of the government in\nyour state.CHAPTER 4\nWorking o f\nInstituti ons\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n57\n4.1 H OW IS A MAJOR POLICY  DECISION  TAKEN?\nPensions, signed the Order. It was\nquite short, barely one page. It\nlooked like any ordinary circular or\nnotice that you may have seen in\nschool. The government issues hun-\ndreds of orders every day on differ-\nent matters. But this one was very\nimportant and became a source of\ncontroversy for several years. Let us\nsee how the decision was taken and\nwhat happened later.A Government OrderA Government OrderA Government OrderA Government OrderA Government Order\nOn August 13, 1990, the Government\nof India issued an Order. It was\ncalled an Office Memorandum. Like\nall government orders, it had a num-\nber and is known by that: O. M. No.\n36012/31/90-Est (SCT), dated\n13.8.1990. The Joint Secretary, an\nofficer in the Department of Person-\nnel and Training in the Ministry of\nPersonnel, Public Grievances and\nWORKIN G OF INSTITUTI ONS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n58 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nThis Order announced a major\npolicy decision. It said that 27 per\ncent of the vacancies in civil posts\nand services under the Government\nof India are reserved for the Socially\nand Educationally Backward Classes\n(SEBC). SEBC is another name for all\nthose people who belong to castes\nthat are considered backward by the\ngovernment. The benefit of job res-\nervation was till then available only\nto Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes. Now a new third category\ncalled SEBC was introduced. Only\npersons who belong to backward\nclasses were eligible for this quota\nof 27 per cent jobs. Others could not\ncompete for these jobs.\nT TT TThe D he Dhe D he Dhe D e ee eecision M cision Mcision M cision Mcision M ak akak akakers ersers ersers\nWho decided to issue this\nMemorandum? Clearly, such a big\ndecision could not have been taken\nby the person who signed that\ndocument. The officer was merely\nimplementing the instructions given\nby the Minister of Personnel, Public\nGrievances and Pensions, of which\nthe Department was a part. We can\nguess that such a major decision\nwould have involved other major\nfunctionaries in our country. You\nhave already read in the previous\nclass about some of them. Let us go\nover some of the main points that\nyou covered then:\n/UIstopPresident is the head of the state\nand is the highest formal authority\nin the country.\n/UIstopPrime Minister is the head of the\ngovernment  and actually exercises\nall governmental powers. He takes\nmost of the decisions in the\nCabinet meetings.\n/UIstopParliament consists of the\nPresident and two Houses, Lok\nSabha and Rajya Sabha. The Prime\nMinister must have the support of\na majority of Lok Sabha members.So, were all these people involved\nin this decision regarding the Office\nMemorandum? Let us find out.\nACTIVITY\n/UIstopWhich points, other than the ones mentioned\nabove, do you recall about these institutions\nfrom the previous class? Discuss in class.\n/UIstopCan you think of a major decision made by\nyour state gover nment? How were the Gover -\nnor, the Council of Ministers, the state assem-\nbly and the cour ts involved in that decision?\nThis Office Memorandum was the\nculmination of a long chain of\nevents. The Government of India had\nappointed the Second Backward\nClasses Commission in 1979. It was\nheaded by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was\npopularly called the Mandal\nCommission. It was asked to\ndetermine the criteria to identify the\nsocially and educationally backward\nclasses in India and recommend\nsteps to be taken for their\nadvancement. The Commission gave\nits Report in 1980 and made many\nrecommendations. One of these",
