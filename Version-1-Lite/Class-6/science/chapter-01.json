Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed “matter”. The air we br\neathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small dr op of water or a\nparticle of sand — every thing is matter . We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surr oundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers  classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\nTatva” — air , earth, fir e, sky and water .\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Gr eek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter .\nModer n day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical natur e.\nIn this chapter we shall lear n about\nmatter based on its physical pr operties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1  Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 M ATTER  IS MADE  UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the natur e of matter . One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, wher eas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the natur e\nof matter  — is it continuous or particulate?Activity ______________ 1.1\n•Take a 100 mL beaker .\n•Fill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water .\n•Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass r od.\n•Observe any change in water level.\n•What do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n•Wher e does it disappear?\n•Does the level of water change?\nIn or der to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles. What was ther e in the spoon,  salt\nor sugar , has now spr ead thr oughout  water .\nThis is  illustrated in Fig. 1.1.\n1.1.2 HOW SMALL  ARE THESE  PARTICLES\nOF\n MATTER ?\nActivity ______________ 1.2\n•Take 2–3 crystals of potassium\npermanganate and dissolve them in\n100 mL of water .Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water , the particles\nof salt get into the spaces between particles\nof water .\n*The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).\n**The SI unit of volume is cubic metr e (m3). The common unit of measuring volume is\nlitre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm3, 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm3.1\nM MMMMATTER\nATTERATTER ATTERATTER     IN ININ ININ O  O O  O OUR URUR URUR S  S S  S SURROUNDINGSURROUNDINGSURROUNDINGSURROUNDINGSURROUNDINGSChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nSCIENCE 2•Take out approximately 10 mL of this\nsolution and put it into 90 mL of clear\nwater .\n•Take out 10 mL of this solution and\nput it into another 90 mL of clear water .\n•Keep diluting the solution like this 5 to\n8 times.\n•Is the water still colour ed ?1.2.2 PARTICLES  OF MATTER  ARE\nCONTINUOUSLY  MOVING\nActivity Activity Activity Activity Activity 1.3 1.31.3 1.31.3\n•Put an unlit incense stick in a corner\nof your class. How close do you have to\ngo near it so as to get its smell?\n•Now light the incense stick. What\nhappens? Do you get the smell sitting\nat a distance?\n•Record your observations.\nActivity Activity Activity Activity Activity 1.4 1.41.4 1.41.4\n•Take two glasses/beakers filled with\nwater .\n•Put a dr op of blue or r ed ink slowly\nand car efully along the sides of the first\nbeaker and honey in the same way in\nthe second beaker .\n•Leave them undisturbed in your house\nor in a cor ner of the class.\n•Recor d your observations.\n•What do you observe immediately after\nadding the ink dr op?\n•What do you observe immediately after\nadding a dr op of honey?\n•How many hours or days does it take\nfor the colour of ink to spr ead evenly\nthroughout the water?\nActivity Activity Activity Activity Activity  1.5  1.5 1.5  1.5 1.5\n•Drop a crystal of copper sulphate or\npotassium per manganate into a glass\nof hot water and another containing\ncold water . Do not stir the solution.\nAllow the crystals to settle at the\nbottom.\n•What do you observe just above the\nsolid crystal in the glass?\n•What happens as time passes?\n•What does this suggest about the\nparticles of solid and liquid?\n•Does the rate of mixing change with\ntemperatur e? Why and how?\nFrom the above thr ee activities (1.3, 1.4 and\n1.5), we can conclude the following:Fig. 1.2:  Estimating how small ar e the particles of\nmatter . With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium per manganate can\ncolour a lar ge volume of water (about\n1000 L). So we conclude that there must be\nmillions of tiny particles in just one crystal\nof potassium permanganate, which keep\non dividing themselves into smaller and\nsmaller particles.\nThe same activity can be done using 2 mL\nof Dettol",
