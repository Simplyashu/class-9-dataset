In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic\ngovernment has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair\nmanner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on\ninstitutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are\nnecessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions\nneed to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make\na government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working\nthrough the established institutional process must learn not to cross some\nlimits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.\nThis is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by\ndiscussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without\nrights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do\nwe need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is\nfollowed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental\nRights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can\nbe used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them? Finally\nwe take a look at how the scope of rights has been expanding.CHAPTER 5\nDEMOCR ATIC\nRIGHT S\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n75\nDear Mr Tony Blair,\nFirstly, how are you? I sent a\nletter two years ago, why didn’t\nyou reply?!? I was waiting for a\nlong time but you did not reply.\nPlease can you give me an answer\nto my question? Why is my dad in\nprison? Why is he far away in\nthat Guantánamo Bay?! I miss my\ndad so much. I have not seen my\ndad for three years. I know my\ndad has not done anything,\nbecause he is a good man. I hear\neverybody speak about my dad in\na nice way. Your children spend\nChristmas with you, but me and\nmy brothers, and sisters have\nspent Eid alone without our dad\nfor 3 years. What do y ou think\nabout that?\nI hope you will answer me this\ntime.\nThank you,\nFrom: Anas Jamil El-Banna,\n9 years old.\n7/12/20055.1LIFE WITHOUT  RIGHTS\nwere quite central to the\nConstitution because …\nChapter 3: Every adult citizen of\nIndia has the right to ... and to be ...\nChapter 4: If a law is against the\nConstitution, every citizen has the\nright to approach …\nLet us now begin with three\nexamples of what it means to live in\nthe absence of rights.\nP PP PPr rr rrison in G ison in Gison in G ison in Gison in G uan uanuan uanuantanamo B tanamo Btanamo B tanamo Btanamo B a aa aay yy yy\nAbout 600 people were secretly\npicked up by the US forces from all\nover the world and put in a prison\nin Guantanamo Bay, an area near\nCuba controlled by Amercian Navy.\nAnas’s father, Jamil El-Banna, was\namong them. The American\ngovernment said that they were\nenemies of the US and linked to the\nattack on New York on 11\nSeptember 2001. In most cases the\ngovernments of their countries were\nnot asked or even informed about\ntheir imprisonment. Like other\nprisoners, El-Banna’s family got to\nknow that he was in that prison only\nthrough the media. Families of\nprisoners, media or even UN\nrepresentatives were not allowed to\nmeet them. The US army arrested\nthem, interrogated them and\ndecided whether to keep them there\nor not. There was no trial before any\nmagistrate in the US. Nor could\nthese prisoners approach courts in\ntheir own country.\nAmnesty International , an\ninternational human rights\norganisation, collected information\non the condition of the prisoners in\nGuantanamo Bay and reported that\nthe prisoners were being tortured in\nways that violated the US laws. TheyIn this book we have mentioned\nrights again and again. If you\nremember, we have discussed rights\nin each of the four preceding\nchapters. Can you fill in the blanks\nby recalling the rights dimension in\neach chapter?\nChapter 1: A comprehensive\ndefinition of democracy includes …\nChapter 2: Our Constitution makers\nbelieved that fundamental rights\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n76 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nwere being denied the treatment\nthat even prisoners of war must get\nas per international treaties. Many\nprisoners had tried protesting against\nthese conditions by going on a hunger\nstrike. Prisoners were not released\neven after they were officially declared\nnot guilty. An independent inquiry\nby the UN supported these findings.\nThe UN Secretary General said the\nprison in Guantanamo Bay should be\nclosed down. The US government\nrefused to accept these pleas.\nC CC CCitiz itizitiz itizitizens ensens ensens’ ’’ ’’ R  R R  R Righ ighigh ighights in ts ints in ts ints inS SS SSaudi A audi Aaudi A audi Aaudi A r rr rrabia abiaabia abiaabia\nThe case of Guantanamo Bay looks\nlike an exception, for it involves the\ngovernment of one country denying\nrights to citizens of another country.\nLet us therefore look at the case of\nSaudi Arabia and the position of the\ncitizens with regard to their\ngovernment.
