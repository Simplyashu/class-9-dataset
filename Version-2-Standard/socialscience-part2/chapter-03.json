Y ou will notice that small str eams\nflowing from different directions come together\nto for m the main river , which ultimately drains\ninto a large water body such as a lake or a sea\nor an ocean. The area drained by a single river\nsystem is called a drainage basin . A closer\nobservation on a map will indicate that any\nelevated area, such as a mountain or an upland,\nseparates two drainage basins. Such an upland\nis known as a water divide  (Figure 3.1).\nFigure 3.2 : A GorgeDRAINAGE  SYSTEMS  IN INDIA\nThe drai nage systems of India are mainly\ncontrolled by the broad relief features of the\nsubcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers\nare divided into two major groups:\n•the Himalayan rivers; and\n•the Peninsular rivers.\nApart from originating from the two major\nphysiographic region s of India, the Himalayan\nand the Peninsular rivers are different from\neach other  in many ways . Most of the\nHimalayan rivers are perennial .  It means\nthat they have water thr oughout the year .\nThese rivers receive   water from rain as well\nas from melted snow from the lofty\nmountains. The two major Himalayan rivers,\nthe Indus and the Brahmaputra originate\nfrom the north of the mountain ranges. They\nhave cut through the mountains making\ngorges. The Himalayan rivers have long\ncourses from their source to the sea.3\nWater Divide\nSream ASream B\nFigur e 3.1 : W ater Divide\nThe world’s largest drainage\nbasin is of the Amazon river\n• Which river has the largest basin in India?Stream  AStream B\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n18 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-IThey perform intensive erosional activity in\ntheir upper courses and carry huge loads  of\nsilt and sand. In the middle and  the lower\ncourses, these rivers form meanders,  oxbow\nlakes, and many other depositional features\nin their floodplains. They also have well-\ndeveloped  deltas (Figure 3.3).\nA large number of the Peninsular rivers are\nseasonal, as their flow is dependent on rainfall.\nDuring the dry season, even the large rivers\nhave reduced flow of water in their channels.\nThe Peninsular rivers have shorter and\nshallower courses as compared to their\nHimalayan counterparts. However , some of\nthem originate in the central highlands and flow\ntowards the west. Can you identify two such\nlarge rivers? Most of the rivers of peninsular\nIndia originate in the W ester n Ghats and flow\ntowards the Bay of Bengal.\nSource of River\nUpper Course\nMiddle Course\nOx-Bow Lake\nLower\nCourseMeander\nDelta\nFigure 3.3 : Some Features Made by RiversThe Himalayan Rivers\nThe major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the\nGanga and the Brahmaputra. These rivers are\nlong, and are joined by many large and\nimportant tributaries. A river alongwith its\ntributaries may be called a river system.\nThe Indus River System\nThe river Indus rises in T ibet, near Lake\nMansar owar. Flowing west, it enters India in the\nLadakh . It forms a picturesque gorge in this\npart. Several tributaries, the Zaskar , the Nubra,\nthe Shyok  and \nthe Hunza , join it in the Kashmir\nregion. The Indus flows through Baltistan and\nGilgit and emerges from the mountains at Attock.\nThe Satl uj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and\nthe Jhelum join together to enter the Indus near\nMithankot in Pakistan. Beyond this, the Indus\nflows southwards eventually reaching the\nArabian Sea, ea st of Karachi.   The Indus plain\nhas a very gentle slope. With a total length of\n2900 km, the Indus is one of the longest rivers\nof the world. A little over a third of the Indus\nbasin is located in India Ladakh , Jammu and\nKashmir , Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the\nrest is in Pakistan.\n• According to the regulations\nof the Indus Water Treaty (1960) , India can\nuse only 20 per cent of the total water carried by\nthe Indus river system. This water is used for\nirrigation in Punjab, Haryana and the southern\nand the western parts of Rajasthan.\nThe Ganga River System\nThe headwaters of the Ganga, called the\n‘Bhagirathi’ is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and\njoined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in\nUttarakhand. At Haridwar , the Ganga emer ges\nfrom the mountains on to the plains.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nDRAINAGE 19Figure 3.4 : Major Rivers and Lakes\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n20 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I\nThe Ganga is joined by many tributaries\nfrom the Himalayas, a few of them being major\nrivers, such as the Y amuna, the Ghaghara, the\nGandak and the Kosi. The river Y amuna rises\nfrom the Y amunotri Glacier in the Himalayas.\nIt flows parallel to the Ganga and as a right\nbank tributary meets the Ganga at Allahabad.\nThe Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise\nin the Nepal Himalaya. They are the rivers,\nwhich flood parts of the northern plains every\nyear, causing widespr ead damage to life and\nproperty, whereas, they enrich the soil for\nagricultural use.\nThe main tributaries, which come from the\npeninsular uplands, are the Chambal, the\nBetwa and the Son.
