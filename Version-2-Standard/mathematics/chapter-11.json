We will now\nstudy the surface area of cone.\nSo far , we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally ,\nsuch figures are called prisms . Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a\nprism (These kinds of solids are called pyramids. ). Let us see how we can generate\nthem.\nActivity :  Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick\nstring along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 1 1.1(a)].\nHold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle\nabout the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that\nthe triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 1 1.1(b)]? Does it remind\nyou of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that shape [see\nFig. 1 1.1 (c) and (d)]?\nFig. 1 1.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n138 MATHEMA TICS\nThis is called a right cir cular cone . In Fig. 1 1.1(c)\nof the right circular cone, the point A is called the\nvertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius\nand AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B\nwill be the centre of circular base of the cone. The\nheight, radius and slant height of the cone are usually\ndenoted by h, r and l respectively . Once again, let us\nsee what kind of cone we can not call a right circular\ncone. Here, you are (see Fig. 1 1.2)! What you see in\nthese figures are not right circular cones; because in\n(a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its base\nis not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the base is\nnot circular .\nAs in the case of cylinder , since we will be studying only about right circular cones,\nremember that by ‘cone’  in this chapter , we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’\nActivity :  (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped\npaper , straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms\nthe surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height  of\nthe cone which is represented by l). It looks like a part of a round cake.\n(ii) If you now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together , you can see that\nthe curved portion of Fig. 1 1.3 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.\nFig. 1 1.3\n(iii) If the paper like the one in Fig. 1 1.3 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,\nalong the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,\nwhose height is the slant height l of the cone.\n(iv) Now the area of each triangle = 1\n2 × base of each triangle × l.\nSo, area of the entire piece of paperFig. 1 1.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 139\n=sum of the areas of all the triangles\n=1 2 31 1 1\n2 2 2b l b l b l+ + +⋯ = ( ) 1 2 31\n2l b b b + + +⋯\n=1\n2 × l × length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 1 1.3(c)\n(as b1 + b2 + b3 + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)\nBut the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone\nand the circumference of the base of the cone = 2 πr, where r is the base radius of the\ncone.\nSo,Curved Surface Area of a Cone = 1\n2 × l × 2πππ ππr = π ππ ππrl\nwhere r is its base radius and l its slant height.\nNote that l2 = r2 + h2 (as can be seen from Fig. 1 1.4), by\napplying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the  height  of the\ncone.\nTherefore, l = 2 2r h+\nNow if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r\nis also required whose area is πr2.\nSo,Total Surface Area of a Cone = π ππππrl + π\nππ ππr2 = π ππππr(l + r)\nExample 1 :  Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height\nis 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm.\nSolution :  Curved surface area = πrl\n=22\n7 × 7 × 10 cm2\n=220 cm2\nExample 2 :  The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the\ncurved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use π = 3.14).\nSolution :  Here, h = 16 cm and r = 12 cm.\nSo, from l2 =h2 + r2, we have\nl =2 216 12+  cm = 20 cmFig. 1 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n140 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, curved surface area =πrl\n=3.14 × 12 × 20 cm2\n=753.6 cm2\nFurther , total surface area =πrl + πr2\n=(753.6 + 3.14 × 12 × 12) cm2\n=(753.6 + 452.16) cm2\n=1205.76 cm2\nExample 3 :  A corn cob (see Fig. 1 1.5), shaped somewhat\nlike a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and\nlength (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm2 of the surface of the\ncob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains\nyou would find on the entire cob.\nSolution :  Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn\ncob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total\nnumber of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we\nneed to find its slant height.\nHere, l",
