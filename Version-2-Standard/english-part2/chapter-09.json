For eight years I was a\nvillage schoolteacher and then I lost my place thr ough intrigues.\nI fell a victim to calumny.  It is a year now since I have had\nanything to do.”\nThe advocate, Ser gei, looked at the ragged, fawn-colour ed\novercoat of the suppliant, at his dull, drunken eyes, at the r ed\nspot on either cheek, and it seemed to him as if he had seen this\nman somewher e befor e.\n“I have now had an of fer of a position in the pr ovince of Kaluga,”\nthe mendicant went on, “but I haven’t the money to get ther e.\nHelp me kindly; I am ashamed to ask, but — I am obliged to\nby cir cumstances.”\nSergei’s eyes fell on the man’s overshoes, one of which was\nhigh and the other low, and he suddenly r emember ed something.\n“Look her e, it seems to me I met you the day befor e yester day\nin Sadovya Str eet,” he said; “but you told me then that you wer e\na student who had been expelled, and not a village schoolteacher .\nDo you r emember?”\n“N-no, that can’t be so,” mumbled the beggar , taken aback. “I\nam a village schoolteacher , and if you like I can show you\nmy papers.”\n“Have done with lying! Y ou called yourself a student and even\ntold me what you had been expelled for . Don’t you r emember?”\nSergei flushed and tur ned fr om the ragged cr eature with an\nexpression of disgust.9. The Beggar\nWhat induced the beggar , Lushkoff, to change his\nways?  Let’ s read and find out.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nThe Beggar/ 57\n“This is dishonesty, my dear sir!” he cried angrily. “This is\nswindling — I shall send the police for you, damn you!”\n“Sir!” he said, laying his hand on his heart, “the fact is I was\nlying! I am neither a  student nor a schoolteacher .  All that was\nfiction.  For merly I sang in a Russian choir and was sent away\nfor drunkenness.  But what else can I do?  I can’t get along\nwithout lying.  No one will give me anything when I tell the truth,\nwhat can I do?”\n“What can you do?  Y ou ask what you can do?” cried\nSergei, coming close to him. “W ork! That’s what you can do!\nYou must work!”\n“Work — yes. I know that myself; but wher e can I find work?”\n“How would you like to chop wood for me?”\n“I wouldn’t r efuse to do that, but in these days even skilled\nwood-cutters find themselves sitting without br ead.”\n“Will you come and chop wood for me?”\n“Yes sir , I will.”\n“Very well; we’ll soon find out.”\nSergei hastened along, rubbing his hands. He called his cook\nout of the kitchen.\n“Her\ne, Olga,” he said, “take this gentleman into the wood-shed\nand let him chop wood.”\nThe scar ecrow of a beggar shrugged his shoulders, as if in\nperplexity, and went irr esolutely after the cook.  It was obvious\nfrom his gait that he had not consented to go and chop wood\nbecause he was hungry and wanted work, but simply fr om pride\nand shame and because he had been trapped by his own wor ds.\nIt was obvious, too, that his str ength had been under mined by\nvodka and that he was unhealthy and did not feel the slightest\ninclination for toil.\nSergei hurried into the dining-r oom. Fr om its windows one\ncould see the wood-shed and everything that went on in the yar d.\nStanding at the window, Ser gei saw the cook and the beggar come\nout into the yar d by the back door and make their way acr oss the\ndirty snow to the shed. Olga glar ed wrathfully at her companion,\nshoved him aside with her elbow, unlocked the shed, and angrily\nbanged the door .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n58 / Moments\nNext he saw the pseudo-teacher seat himself on a log and\nbecome lost in thought with his r ed cheeks r esting on his fists.\nThe woman flung down an axe at his feet, spat angrily, and,\njudging fr om the expr ession of her lips, began to scold him. The\nbeggar irr esolutely pulled a billet of wood towar ds him, set it up\nbetween his feet, and tapped it feebly with the axe. The billet\nwaver ed and fell down.  The beggar again pulled it to him, blew\non his fr eezing hands, and tapped it with his axe cautiously, as if\nafraid of hitting his overshoe or of cutting of f his finger; the stick\nof wood again fell to the gr ound.\nSergei’s anger had vanished and he now began to feel a little\nsorry and ashamed of himself for having set a spoiled, drunken,\nperhaps sick man to work at menial labour in the cold.\nAn hour later Olga came in and announced that the wood had\nall been chopped.\n“Good! Give him half a r ouble,” said Ser gei.  “If he wants to he\ncan come back and cut wood on the first day of each month.  W e\ncan always find work for him.”\nOn the first of the month the waif made his appearance and\nagain ear ned half a r ouble, although he could bar ely stand on his\nlegs. Fr om that day on he often appear ed in the yar d and every\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nThe Beggar/ 59\ntime work was found for him.
