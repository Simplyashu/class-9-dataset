If\nyou live in the plains, you are familiar with the\nvast stretches of plain land. In contrast, if you\nlive in hilly region, the rugged terrain with\nmountains and valleys are common features.\nIn fact, our country has practically all major\nphysical features of the earth, i.e., mountains,\nplains, deserts, plateaus and islands.\nThe land of India displays great physical\nvariation. Geologically, the Peninsular Plateau\nconstitutes one of the ancient landmasses on\nthe earth’s surface. It was supposed to be one\nof the most stable land blocks. The Himalayas\nand the Northern Plains are the most recent\nlandforms. From the view point of geology,\nHimalayan mountains form an unstable zone.\nThe whole mountain system of Himalaya\nrepresents a very youthful topography with\nhigh peaks, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers.\nThe northern plains are formed of alluvial\ndeposits. The peninsular plateau is composed\nof igneous and metamorphic rocks with gently\nrising hills and wide valleys.\nMAJOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC  DIVISIONS\nThe physical  features of India can be grouped\nunder the following physiographic divisions\n(Figure 2.2):PHYSICAL  FEATURES OF INDIA\n(1)The Himalayan Mountains\n(2)The Northern Plains\n(3)The Peninsular Plateau\n(4)The Indian Desert\n(5)The Coastal Plains\n(6)The Islands\nThe Himalayan Mountains\nThe Himal ayas, geologically young and\nstructurally fold mountains stretch over the\nnorthern borders of India. These mountain\nranges run in a west-east direction from the\nIndus to the Brahmaputra. The Himalayas\nrepresent the loftiest and one of the most\nrugged mountain barriers of the world. They\nform an arc, which covers a distance of about\n2,400 Km. Their width varies from 400 Km in\nKashmir to 150 Km in Arunachal Pradesh. The\naltitudinal variations are greater in the eastern\nhalf than those in the western half. The\nHimalaya consists of three parallel ranges in\nits longitudinal extent. A number of valleys lie\nbetween these ranges. The northern-most\nrange is known as the Great or Inner\nHimalayas or the \nHimadri.  It is the most\ncontinuous range consisting of the loftiest\npeaks with an average height of\n6,000 metres. It contains all prominent\nHimalayan peaks.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n8 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I\nSome Highest Peaks of the Himalayas\nPeak Country Height\nin metres\nMt.

The core of this part\nof Himalayas is composed of granite. It is\nperennially snow bound, and a number of\nglaciers descend from this range.Figure 2.1 : Himalayas\nThe range lying to the south of the\nHimadri forms the most rugged mountain\nsystem and is known as Himachal  or lesser\nHimalaya. The ranges are mainly composed\nof highly compressed and altered rocks. The\naltitude varies between 3,700 and 4,500\nmetres and the average width is of 50 Km.\nWhile the Pir Panjal range  forms the longest\nand the most important range, the Dhaula\nDhar  and the Mahabharat  ranges are also\nprominent ones. This range consists of the\nfamous valley of Kashmir , the Kangra and\nKullu V alley in Himachal Pradesh. This\nregion is well-known for its hill stations.\n•  The names of the glaciers and passes\nthat lie in the Great Himalayas.\n•   The  name of  the states where the highest\npeaks are located.• Location of  Mussoorie, Nainital,\nRanikhet from your atlas and also name the state\nwhere they are located.\nThe outer -most range of the Himalayas is\ncalled the Shiwaliks.  They extend over a width\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA 9Figure 2.2 : Relief\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n10 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-IFigure 2.3 : The Himalayas\nFigure 2.4 : Mizo Hillsof 10-50 Km and have an altitude varying\nbetween 900 and 1100 metres. These ranges\nare composed of unconsolidated sediments\nbrought down by rivers from the main\nHimalayan ranges located farther north.\nThese valleys are covered with thick\ngravel and alluvium. The longitudinal valley\nlying between lesser Himalaya and the\nShiwaliks are known as Duns. Dehra Dun,\nKotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of the\nwell-known Duns.\nBesides the longitudinal divisions, the\nHimalayas have been divided on the basis of\nregions from west to east. These divisions\nhave been demarcated by river valleys . For\nexample, the part of Himalayas lying between\nIndus and Satl u\nj has been traditionally\nknown as Punjab Himalaya but it is also\nknown regionally as Kashmir and Himachal\nHimalaya from west to east respectively. The\npart of the Himalayas lying between Satl uj\nand Kali rivers is known as Kumaon\nHimalayas. The Kali and T eesta rivers\ndemarcate the Nepal Himalayas and the part\nlying between T eesta and Dihang rivers is\nknown as As",
