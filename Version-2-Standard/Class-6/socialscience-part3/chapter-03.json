They could\nbe landless labourers in villages  or\npeople living in overcrowded jhuggisjhuggisjhuggis\njhuggisjhuggis  in\ncities. NITI Aayog uses MultidimensionalPoverty as a Challenge Chapter\nPoverty Index to analyse the problem of\npoverty faced by the country. The ratio\nof multidimensional poverty has fallen from\napproximately 55 per cent in 200 5–06,\n25 per cent in 201\n5–16 and to 15 per cent\nin 201 9–21. It is also expected that\nmultidimensional poverty will soon\nreach single digit.\nTwo Typical Cases of Poverty\nUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban Case\nThirty-three year old Ram Saran works\nas a daily-wage labourer in a wheat flour\nmill near Ranchi in Jharkhand. He\nmanages to earn around `3,500 a\nmonth when he finds employment,\nwhich is not often. The money is not\nenough to sustain his family of six— hisPoverty as a Challenge33\nPicture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1   Story  of Ram Saran\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n30  \n  Economics\nwife and four children aged between 12\nyears to six months.  He has to send\nmoney home to his old parents who live\nin a village near Ramgar h. His father ,\na landless labour er, and his br other\nwho lives in Hazaribagh depend on Ram\nSaran for sustenance. Ram Saran lives\nin a one-room rented house in a\ncrowded basti in the outskirts of the\ncity. It  is a temporary shack built of\nbricks and clay tiles. His wife Santa\nDevi, works as a part time maid in a\nfew houses and manages to earn\nanother `1500. They manage a meagre\nmeal of dal and rice twice a day, but\nthere is never enough for all of them.\nHis elder son works as a helper in a\ntea shop to supplement the family ’s\nincome and earns another `700 while\nhis 10-year  old daughter  goes to school\nand takes care of the younger siblings.\nThey have only two pairs of hand-me-\ndown clothes each. New ones are\nbought only when the old clothes\nbecome unwearable. Shoes are a luxury.\nThe younger one relishes the dal-rice\nserved at school .Rural case\nLakha Singh belongs to a small village\nnear Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His\nfamily does not own any land. So, they\ndo odd jobs for the big far mers. W ork\nis erratic and so is income. At times\nthey get paid `200 for a hard day’s\nwork. But often it is in kind like a few\nkilograms of wheat or dal or even\nvegetables for toiling in the farm\nthroughout the day. The family of six\nare barely able to  manage two square\nmeals a day. Lakha lives in a kuchha\nhut on the outskirts of the village. The\nwomen of the family spend the day\nchopping fodder and collecting\nfirewood in the fields. His father , a\ntuberculosis patient, passed away two\nyears ago due to lack of medication.\nHis mother now suffers from the same\ndisease and life is slowly ebbing away.\nAlthough, the village has a primary\nschool, Lakha never went ther e but\nhe is happy to find his children going\nto school. New clothes happen once\nin a few years. Even soap and oil\nare a luxury for the family.\nStudy the above cases of poverty\nand discuss the following issues\nrelated to poverty:\n•Landlessness\n•Unemployment\n•Size of families\n•Literacy levels\n•Health/nutrition\n•Helplessness\nPicture 3.2   Story  of Lakha Singh\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPoverty as a Challenge  \n   31\nThese two typical cases illustrate many\ndimensions of poverty. They show that\npoverty means hunger and lack of shelter .\nThis also speaks about a situation in which\nparents are not able to give their children\nnutritious food three times a day or a\nsituation where sick people cannot afford\ntreatment. Poverty also means lack of\nclean water and sanitation facilities. It also\nmeans lack of a regular job with decent\nminimum wages. Above all, it means living\nwith a sense of helplessness. Poor people\nare in a situation in which they are ill-\ntreated at almost every place, in farms,\nfactories, government offices, hospitals,\nrailway stations, etc. Obviously, nobody\nwould like to live in poverty.\nOne of the biggest challenges of\nindependent India has been to bring\nmillions of its people out of abject poverty.\nMahatama Gandhi said that India would\nbe truly independent only when the poorest\nof its people become free of human\nsuffering.\nPoverty as seen by social scientists\nSince poverty has many facets, social\nscientists look at it through a variety of\nindicators.
