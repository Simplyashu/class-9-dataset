These\nproduction activities need various types\nof resources — natural resources, man-\nmade items, human effort, money, etc. As\nwe read through the story of Palampur ,\nwe will learn how various resources\ncombine to produce the desired goods and\nservices in the village.\nIntroduction\nPalampur is well-connected with\nneighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,\na big village, is 3 kms from Palampur . An\nall weather road connects the village to\nRaiganj and further on to the nearest\nsmall town of Shahpur . Many kinds of\ntransport are visible on this road starting\nfrom bullock carts, tongas , bogeys (wooden\ncart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery\n(gur) and other commodities to motor\nvehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors\nand trucks.\nThis village has about 450 families\nbelonging to several different castes. The\n80 upper caste families own the majority\nof land in the village. Their houses, some\nof them quite large, are made of brick with\ncement plastering. The SCs (dalits)\ncomprise one third of the population and\nlive in one corner of the village and in\nmuch smaller houses some of which are\nof mud and straw. Most of the houses haveelectric connections. Electricity powers all\nthe tubewells in the fields and is used in\nvarious types of small business. Palampur\nhas two primary schools and one high\nschool. There is a primary health centre\nrun by the government and one private\ndispensary where the sick are treated.\n•The description above shows that\nPalampur has fairly well-developed\nsystem of roads, transport, electricity,\nirrigation, schools and health centre.\nCompare these facilities with those in\nyour nearby village.\nThe story of Palampur , an imaginary\nvillage, will take us through the different\ntypes of production activities in the\nvillage. In villages across India, farming\nis the main production activity. The other\nproduction activities, referred to as non-\nfarm activities include small\nmanufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,\netc. W e shall take a lo ok at both these\ntypes of activities, after learning a few\ngeneral things about production.The Story of Village PalampurThe Story of Village Palampur1\nChapter1\nPicture 1.1  Scene of a village\n*The narrative is partly based on a research study by G ilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in W estern\nUttar Pradesh.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2   \n   EconomicsOrganisation of Production\nThe aim of production is to produce the\ngoods and services that we want. There\nare four requirements for production of\ngoods and services.\nThe first requirement is land , and\nother natural resources such as water ,\nforests, minerals.\nThe second requirement is labour , i.e.\npeople who will do the work. Some\nproduction activities require highly\neducated workers to perform the\nnecessary tasks. Other activities require\nworkers who can do manual work. Each\nworker is providing the labour necessary\nfor production.\nThe third requirement is physical\ncapital , i.e. the variety of inputs required\nat every stage during production. What\nare the items that come under physical\ncapital?\n(a) Tools, machines, buildings:  Tools and\nmachines range from very simple tools\nsuch as a farmer’s plough to\nsophisticated machines such as\ngenerators, turbines, computers, etc.\nTools, machines, buildings can be used\nin production over many years, and\nare called fixed capital .\n(b) Raw materials and money in hand:\nProduction requires a variety of raw\nmaterials such as the yarn used by\nthe weaver and the clay used by the\npotter . Also, some money is always\nrequired during production to make\npayments and buy other necessary\nitems. Raw materials and money in\nhand are called working capital .\nUnlike tools, machines and buildings,\nthese are used up in production.\nThere is a fourth requirement to o. You\nwill need knowledge and enterprise to be\nable to put together land, labour and\nphysical capital and produce an output\neither to use yourself or to sell in the\nmarket. This these days is called humancapital. W e shall learn more about human\ncapital  in the next chapter .\n•In the picture, identify the land, labour\nand fixed capital used in production.\nPicture 1.2 A factory, with several  labourers\nand  machines\nEvery production is organised by\ncombining land, labour , physical capital\nand human capital, which are known as\nfactors of production . As we read\nthrough the story of Palampur , we will\nlearn more about the first three factors\nof production. For convenience, we will\nrefer to the physical capital as the capital\nin this chapter .\nFarming in Palampur\n1.Land is fixed\nFarming is the main production activity\nin Palampur . ",
