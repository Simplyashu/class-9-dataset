There are certain basic rules that the citizens\nand the government have to follow. All such rules together are called\nconstitution. As the supreme law of the country, the constitution determines\nthe rights of citizens, the powers of the government and how the government\nshould function.\nIn this chapter we ask some basic questions about the constitutional\ndesign of a democracy. Why do we need a constitution? How are the\nconstitutions drawn up? Who designs them and in what way? What are\nthe values that shape the constitutions in democratic states? Once a\nconstitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the\nchanging conditions?\nOne recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is\nthat of South Africa. We begin this chapter by looking at what happened\nthere and how the South Africans went about this task of designing their\nconstitution. Then we turn to how the Indian Constitution was made,\nwhat its foundational values are, and how it provides a good framework\nfor the conduct of citizens’ life and that of the government.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n19\n2.1DEMOCRA TIC CONSTITUTI ON IN\nSOUTH  AFRIC\nA\n“I have fought against white domination\nand I have fought against black\ndomination. I have cherished the ideal of\na democratic and free society in which all\npersons live together in harmony and with\nequal opportunities. It is an ideal which I\nhope to live for and to achieve. But if\nneeds be, it is an ideal for which I am\nprepared to die. ”\nThis was Nelson Mandela, being\ntried for treason by the white South\nAfrican government. He and seven\nother leaders were sentenced to life\nimprisonment in 1964 for daring to\noppose the apartheid  regime in his\ncountry. He spent the next 27 years\nin South Africa’s most dreaded\nprison, Robben Island.\nS SS SStr trtr trtruggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against apar theid theidtheid theidtheid\nApartheid was the name of a system\nof racial discrimination unique to\nSouth Africa. The white Europeans\nimposed this system on South\nAfrica. During the seventeenth  and\neighteenth  centuries, the trading\ncompanies from Europe occupied it\nwith arms and force, in the way they\noccupied India. But unlike India, a\nlarge number of ‘whites’ had settled\nin South Africa and became the\nlocal rulers. The system ofapartheid divided the people and\nlabelled  them on the basis of their\nskin colour. The native people of\nSouth Africa are black in colour.\nThey made up  about three-fourth\nof the population and  were  called\n‘blacks’. Besides these two groups,\nthere were people of mixed races\nwho were called ‘coloured’ and\npeople who migrated from India.\nThe white rulers treated all non-\nwhites as inferiors. The non-whites\ndid not have voting rights.\nThe apartheid system was\nparticularly oppressive for the\nblacks. They were forbidden from\nliving in white areas. They could\nwork in white areas only if they had\na permit.

This was\ncalled segregation. They could not\neven visit the churches where the\nwhites worshipped. Blacks could not\nform associations or protest against\nthe terrible treatment.\nSince 1950, the blacks, coloured\nand Indians fought against the\napartheid system. They launched\nprotest marches and strikes. The\nAfrican National Congress (ANC) was\nthe umbrella organisation that led\nthe struggle against the policies of\nsegregation. This included many\nworkers’ unions and the Communist\nParty. Many sensitive whites also\njoined the ANC to oppose apartheid\nand played a leading role in this\nstruggle. Several countries de-\nnounced apartheid as unjust and\nracist. But the white racist govern-\nment continued to rule by detain-\ning, torturing and killing thousands\nof black and coloured people.\nACTIVITY\n/UIstopMake a poster on the life and str uggle of Nelson\nMandela.\n/UIstopIf available, read some por tions of his autobi-\nography , The L ong W alk to Freedom, in the\nclassroom.\nT TT TTo oo oow ww wwar arar arards a ne ds a neds a ne ds a neds a ne w c w cw c w cw constitution onstitutiononstitution onstitutiononstitution\nAs protests and struggles against\napartheid had increased, the\ngovernment realised that they could",
