The most common form of\ndemocracy in our times is for the people to govern through their\nrepresentatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives\nare elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and\nuseful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition\namong parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an\nelection democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic\nelections from non-democratic elections.\nThe rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of\nthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing\nof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At\neach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.\nTowards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether\nelections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of the\nElection Commission in ensuring free and fair elections.CHAPTER 3\nElec toral\nPolitics\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n35\n3.1 W HY ELECTIONS ?\ngovernment would waive the loans\nof farmers and small businessmen.\nHe promised that this would be the\nfirst action of his government.\nThe people were unhappy with the\nexisting government.
