Now\nsuppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height.\nCan you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40\nm, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want to apply the\nformula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate\nthe height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section.\nHeron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in\nEgypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on\nmathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and\nvaried that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer\nin these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with\nproblems on mensuration written in three books. Book I\ndeals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles,\ntrapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised\nquadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of\ncylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has\nderived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in\nterms of its three sides.\nThe formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s\nformula . It is stated as:\nArea of a triangle = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − − (I)\nHeron (10 C.E. – 75 C.E.)\nFig. 10.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n132 MATHEMA TICS\nwher e a, b and c ar e the sides of the triangle , and s = semi-perimeter , i.e., half the\nperimeter of the triangle  = 2a b c+ +,\nThis formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle\neasily . Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned\nabove (see Fig. 10.2).\nLet us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,\nso that we have s = 40 24 32\n2+ + m = 48 m.\ns – a = (48 – 40) m = 8 m,\ns – b = (48 – 24) m = 24 m,\ns – c = (48 – 32) m = 16 m.\nTherefore, area of the park ABC\n= ( ) ( ) ( )− − −s s a s b s c\n= 2 248 8 24 16 m 384m× × × =\nWe see that 322 + 242 = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 402. Therefore, the sides of the park\nmake a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse\nand the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90°.\nWe can check that the area of the park is 1\n2 × 32 × 24 m2 = 384 m2.\nWe find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron’ s\nformula.\nNow using Heron’ s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other\ntriangles discussed earlier viz.,\n(i)equilateral triangle with side 10 cm.\n(ii)isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.\nYou will see that\nFor (i), we have s = 10 10 10\n2+ + cm = 15 cm.Fig. 10.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nHERON ’S FORMULA 133\nArea of triangle  = 15(15 10) (15 10) (15 10)− − −  cm2\n                         =2 215 5 5 5 cm 25 3 cm× × × =\nFor (ii), we have s = 8 5 5cm 9 cm2+ +=\nArea of triangle = 9(9 8) (9 5) (9 5)− − − cm2 = 2 29 1 4 4 cm 12 cm .× × × =\nLet us now solve some more examples:\nExample 1 :  Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 1 1 cm and\nthe perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 10.3).\nSolution :  Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and b = 11 cm.\nThird side c = 32 cm – (8 + 1 1) cm = 13 cm\nSo, 2s =32, i.e., s = 16 cm,\ns – a =(16 – 8) cm = 8 cm,\ns – \nb =(16 – 1 1) cm = 5 cm,\ns – c =(16 – 13) cm = 3 cm.\nTherefore, area of the triangle = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − −\n=2 216 8 5 3 cm 8 30 cm× × × =\nExample 2 :  A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 10.4). A\ngardener Dhania  has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How\nmuch area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the\nrate of `20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side.\nSolution :  For finding area of the park, we have\n2s =50 m + 80 m + 120 m = 250 m.\ni.e., s =125 m\nNow,s – \na =(125 – 120) m = 5 m,\ns – b =(125 – 80) m = 45 m,\ns – c =(125 – 50) m = 75 m.Fig. 10.3\nFig. 10.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n134 MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore, area of the park  = ( ) ( ) ( )s s a s b s c− − −\n=125 5 45 75× × × m2\n=2375 15 m\nAlso, perimeter of the park =  AB + BC + CA  = 250 m\nTherefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m – 3 m (to be left for gate)\n=247 m\nAnd so the cost of fencing = `20 × 247 = `4940\nExample 3 :  The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter\nis 300 m. Find its area.\nSolution :  Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3 x, 5x and 7 x (see Fig. 10.5).\nThen, we know that 3 x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle)\nTherefore, 15 x = 300, which gives x = 20.\nSo the sides of the triangle are 3 × 20 m, 5 × 20 m and 7 × 20 m\ni.e., 60 m, 100 m and 140 m.\nCan you now find the area [Using Heron’ s formula]?\nWe have s = 60 100 140\n2+ + m = 150 m,\nand area will be 150(150 60) (150 100) (150 140)− − − m2\n=150 90 50 10× × × m2\n=21500 3 m\nEXE",
