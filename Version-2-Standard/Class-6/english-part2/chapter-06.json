Weathering the Storm in Ersama\nThe cyclone that hit Orissa in October 1999\nkilled thousands of people and dev astated\nhundreds of villages. For two dreadful nights\nPrashant, a young man, w as  marooned on the\nroof of a house. On the third day he decided to\ngo to his village. Did he find his family?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n38 / Moments\nuprooted and crashed to the earth.  Scr eams r ent the air as people\nand houses wer e swiftly washed away. The angry waters swirled\ninto his friend’s house, neck deep. The building was of brick and\nmortar and was str ong enough to survive the  devastation of the\nwind’s velocity of 350 km per hour . But the cold terr or of the\nfamily gr ew with the crashing of tr ees that had got upr ooted  and\nfallen on their house, some time in the middle of the night,\ndamaging its r oof and walls.\nThe crazed destruction wr ought by the cyclone and the sur ge\nof the ocean continued for the next thirty-six hours, although wind\nspeeds had r educed somewhat by the next mor ning.  T o escape\nthe waters rising in the house, Prashant and his friend’s family\nhad taken r efuge on the r oof.  Prashant will never for get the shock\nhe experienced at his first glimpse of the devastation wr ought by\nthe super cyclone, in the gr ey light of the early mor ning.  A raging,\ndeadly, br own sheet of water cover ed everything as far as the eye\ncould see; only fractur ed cement houses still stood in a few places.\nBloated animal car casses and human corpses floated in every\ndirection.  All r ound even huge old tr ees had fallen.  T wo coconut\ntrees had fallen on the roof of their house.  This was a blessing in\ndisguise, because the tender coconuts fr om the tr ees kept the\ntrapped family fr om starving in the several days that followed.\nFor the next two days, Prashant sat huddled with his friend’s\nfamily in the open on the r ooftop.  They fr oze in the cold and incessant\nrain; the rain water washed away Prashant’s tears.  The only thought\nthat flashed thr ough his mind was whether his family had survived\nthe fury of the super cyclone.  Was he to be ber eaved once again?\nTwo days later , which seemed to Prashant like two years, the\nrain ceased and the rain waters slowly began to r ecede. Prashant\nwas deter mined to seek out his family without further delay.  But\nthe situation was still danger ous, and his friend’s family pleaded\nwith Prashant to stay back a little while longer .  But Prashant\nknew he had to go.\nHe equipped himself with a long, stur dy stick, and then started\non his eighteen-kilometr e expedition back to his village thr ough\nthe swollen flood waters.  It was a jour ney he would never for get.\nHe constantly had to use his stick to locate the r oad, to deter mine\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nWeathering the Storm in Ersama/ 39\nwher e the water was most shallow.  At places it was waist deep,\nand pr ogress was slow.  At several points, he lost the r oad and\nhad to swim.  After some distance, he was r elieved to find two\nfriends of his uncle who wer e also r eturning to their village. They\ndecided to move ahead together .\nAs they waded thr ough the waters, the scenes they witnessed\ngrew mor e and mor e macabr e.  They had to push away many\nhuman bodies — men, women, childr en — and car casses of dogs,\ngoats and cattle that the curr ent swept against them as they moved\nahead.  In every village that they passed, they could bar ely see a\nhouse standing.  Prashant now wept out loud and long.  He was\nsure that his family could not have survived this catastr ophe.\nEventually, Prashant r eached his village, Kalikuda. His heart\nwent cold. Wher e their home once stood, ther e wer e only\nremnants of its r oof.  Some of their belongings wer e caught,\nmangled and twisted in the branches of tr ees just visible above\nthe dark waters. Y oung Prashant decided to go to the Red Cr oss\nshelter to look for his family.\nAmong the first people he saw in the cr owd was his mater nal\ngrandmother .  Weak with hunger , she rushed to him, her hands\noutstr etched, her eyes brimming.  It was a miracle.  They had\nlong given him up for dead.\nQuickly wor d spr ead and his extended family gather ed around\nhim, and hugged him tight in r elief. Prashant anxiously scanned\nthe motley, batter ed gr oup.
