This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.\nWe hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavor by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development\ncomm",
