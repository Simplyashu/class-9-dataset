The idea of divisibility\nof matter was consider ed long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter ( padarth ), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible.  He named these particles\nParmanu . Another Indian philosopher ,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles nor mally exist\nin a combined for m which gives us various\nforms of matter .\nAround the same era, ancient Gr eek\nphilosophers – Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter , a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further . Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists r\necognised the dif ference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame inter ested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.\nAntoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination.\n3.1Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established aftermuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L. Proust.\n3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF MASS\nIs there a change in mass when a chemical\nchange (chemical reaction) takes place?\nActivity ______________ 3.1\n•Take one of the following sets, X and Y\nof chemicals—\nX Y\n(i)copper sulphate sodium carbonate\n(ii)barium chloride sodium sulphate\n(iii) lead nitrate sodium chloride\n•Prepare separately a 5% solution of\nany one pair of substances listed\nunder X and Y each in 10 mL in water .\n•Take a little amount of solution of Y in\na conical flask and some solution of\nX in an ignition tube.\n•Hang the ignition tube in the flask\ncarefully; see that the solutions do not\nget mixed. Put a cork on the flask\n(see Fig. 3.1).\nFig. 3.1:  Ignition tube containing solution of X, dipped\nin a conical flask containing solution of Y3\nAAA\nAATOMS TOMSTOMS TOMSTOMS     AND ANDAND ANDAND M  M M  M MOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESOLECULESChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 27•Weigh the flask with its contents\ncarefully.\n•Now tilt and swirl the flask, so that the\nsolutions X and Y get mixed.\n•Weigh again.\n•What happens in the r eaction flask?\n•Do you think that a chemical r\neaction\nhas taken place?\n•Why should we put a cork on the mouth\nof the flask?\n•Does the mass of the flask and its\ncontents change?\nLaw of conservation of mass states that\nmass can neither be created nor destroyed in\na chemical reaction.\n3.1.2 LAW OF CONSTANT  PROPORTIONS\nLavoisier , along with other scientists, noted\nthat many compounds were composed of two\nor more elements and each such compound\nhad the same elements in the same\nproportions, irrespective of where the\ncompound came from or who prepared it.\nIn a compound such as water , the ratio of\nthe mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is\nalways 1:8, whatever the sour ce of water . Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.\nSimilarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained.\nThis led to the law of constant proportions\nwhich is also known as the law of definite\nproportions. This law was stated by Proust as\n“In a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass ”.\nThe next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws.\nBritish chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the natur e of matter .\nDalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter , which was till then just a philosophy.\nHe took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law ofconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions.\nJohn Dalton was born in\na poor weaver’s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his car eer as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach mathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter .\nAccording to Dalton’s atomic theory, all\nmatter , whether an element, a compound or\na mixtur e is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as foll",
