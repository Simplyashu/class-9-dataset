But, for a scientist all these things\nare actually mixtures of different substances\nand hence not pure. For example, milk is\nactually a mixtur e of water , fat, pr oteins, etc.\nWhen a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pur e single for m of matter .\nAs we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water , minerals, soil, etc., ar e all mixtur es.\n2.1 What is a Mixture?\nMixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pur e form of matter . We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However , sodium chloride is itselfa pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents.\nSimilarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout.\nSoft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances. Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties.\nTherefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance.\n2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES\nDepending upon the nature of the components\nthat form a mixture, we can have different\ntypes of mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.1\n•Let us divide the class into groups A,\nB, C and D.\n•Group A takes a beaker containing\n50 mL of water and one spatula full\nof copper sulphate powder . Group B\ntakes 50 mL of water and two spatula\nfull of copper sulphate powder in a\nbeaker .\n•Groups C and D can take different\namounts of copper sulphate and\npotassium permanganate or common\nsalt (sodium chloride) and mix the\ngiven components to form a mixture.\n•Report the observations on the\nuniformity in colour and texture.\n•Groups A and B have obtained a\nmixture which has a uniform\ncomposition throughout. Such\nmixtures are called homogeneous\nmixtures or solutions. Some other\nexamples of such mixtures are: (i) salt\ndissolved in water and (ii) sugar\ndissolved in water . Compar e theHow do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter ,\nsalt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy\nfrom the market are pure?2\nIII\nIIS SSSS M  M M  M MATTER ATTERATTER ATTERATTER A  A A  A AROUND ROUNDROUND ROUNDROUND  U  U U  U US SS SS P  P P  P PURE UREURE UREURE? ?? ??Chapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nMore to  knowcolour of the solutions of the two\ngroups. Though both the groups have\nobtained copper sulphate solution but\nthe intensity of colour of the solutions\nis different. This shows that a\nhomogeneous mixture can have a\nvariable composition.\n•Groups C and D have obtained\nmixtures, which contain physically\ndistinct parts and have non-uniform\ncompositions. Such mixtures are called\nheterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of\nsodium chloride and iron filings, salt\nand sulphur , and oil and water ar e\nexamples of heterogeneous mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.2\n•Let us again divide the class into four\ngroups— A, B, C and D.\n•Distribute the following samples to\neach group:\n−Few crystals of copper sulphate\nto group A.\n−One spatula full of copper\nsulphate to group B.\n−Chalk powder or wheat flour to\ngroup C.\n−Few drops of milk or ink to\ngroup D.\n•Each group should add the given\nsample in water and stir properly\nusing a glass rod. Are the particles\nin the mixture visible?\n•Direct a beam of light from a torch\nthrough the beaker containing the\nmixtur e and observe fr om the fr ont. W as\nthe path of the beam of light visible?\n•Leave the mixtures undisturbed for\na few minutes (and set up the\nfiltration apparatus in the meantime).\nIs the mixture stable or do the\nparticles begin to settle after some\ntime?\n•Filter the mixture. Is there any\nresidue on the filter paper?\n•Discuss the results and form an\nopinion.\nGroups A and B have got a solution.\nGroup C has got a suspension.\nGroup D has got a colloidal solution.Now, we shall learn about solutions,\nsuspensions and colloidal solutions in the\nfollowing sections.\nuestions\n1.What is meant by a substance?\n2.List the points of differences\nbetween homogeneous and\nheterogeneous mixtures.\n2.2What is a Solution?\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two\nor mor e substances. Y ou come acr oss various\ntypes of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,\nsoda water , etc., ar e all examples of solutions.\nUsually we think of a solution as a liquid that\ncontains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved\nin it. But, we can also have solid solutions\n(alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a\nsolution there is homogeneity at the particle\nlevel. For example, lemonade tastes the same\nthroughout. This shows that particles of sugar\nor salt are evenly di",
