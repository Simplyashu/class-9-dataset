W e obtain most of this food\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry.\nWe read in newspapers that ef forts ar e\nalways being made to impr ove pr oduction\nfrom agricultur e and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the curr ent levels of pr oduction?\nIndia is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is mor e than one billion people,\nand it is still gr owing. As food for this gr owing\npopulation, we will soon need mor e than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year .\nThis can be done by far ming on more land.\nBut India is alr eady intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the ar ea of land under cultivation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to incr ease our\nproduction ef ficiency for both cr ops and\nlivestock.\nEfforts to meet the food demand by\nincr\neasing food pr oduction have led to some\nsuccesses so far . We have had the gr een\nrevolution, which contributed to incr eased\nfood-grain pr oduction. W e have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk.\nHowever , these r evolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively. As a result, there are more\nchances of causing damage to our natural\nresources to the point of destroying their\nbalance completely. Therefore, it is important\nthat we should increase food production\nwithout degrading our environment anddisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence,\nthere is a need for sustainable practices in\nagriculture and animal husbandry.\nAlso, simply increasing grain production\nfor storage in warehouses cannot solve the\nproblem of malnutrition and hunger . People\nshould have money to purchase food. Food\nsecurity depends on both availability of food\nand access to it. The majority of our\npopulation depends on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Increasing the incomes of people\nworking in agriculture is therefore necessary\nto combat the pr oblem of hunger . Scientific\nmanagement practices should be undertaken\nto obtain high yields from farms. For\nsustained livelihood, one should undertake\nmixed farming, intercropping, and integrated\nfarming practices, for example, combine\nagriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/\nbee-keeping.\nThe question thus becomes – how do we\nincrease the yields of crops and livestock?\n12.1Improvement in Crop Yields\nCereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and\nsorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy\nrequirement. Pulses like gram ( chana ), pea\n(matar ), black gram ( urad), green gram ( moong ),\npigeon pea ( arhar ), lentil ( masoor ), provide us with\nprotein. And oil seeds including soyabean,\nground nut, sesame, castor , mustar d, linseed and\nsunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig.\n12.1). V egetables, spices and fruits pr ovide a\nrange of vitamins and minerals in addition to\nsmall amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and\nfats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops\nlike berseem , oats or sudan grass  are raised as\nfood for the livestock.12\nI II IIMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENTMPROVEMENT      IN ININ ININ F  F F  F FOOD OODOOD OODOOD R  R R  R RESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESESOURCESChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nIMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 141the kharif  season from the month of June to\nOctober , and some of the cr ops ar e grown in\nthe winter season, called the rabi season from\nNovember to April. Paddy, soyabean, pigeon\npea, maize, cotton, gr een gram and black\ngram are kharif  crops, wher\neas wheat, gram,\npeas, mustar d, linseed are rabi crops.\nIn India ther e has been a four times\nincrease in the production of food grains from\n1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the\ncultivable land area. How has this incr ease\nin pr oduction been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in far ming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into thr ee stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the cr op plants.\nThe third is the pr otection of the growing and\nharvested cr ops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for impr oving cr op yields\ncan be classified as:\n•Crop variety improvement\n•Crop pr oduction impr ovement\n•Crop protection management.\n12.1.1 CROP VARIETY  IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. V arieties or\nstrains of cr ops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease r esistance, r esponse to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into cr op\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to cr ossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants. This cr ossing may be\nintervarietal (between dif ferent vari",
