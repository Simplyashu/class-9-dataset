The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the pr escribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning.
