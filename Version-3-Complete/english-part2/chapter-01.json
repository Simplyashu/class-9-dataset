Some walked,\nsome r ode on horses, others sat, being carried in bamboo and\nbullock carts. One little boy ran between his father’s legs,\nbrimming over with life and laughter .1.  The Lost Child\nA child goes to a fair with  his parents. He is happy\nand excited and w ants the sweets and toys\ndisplayed there. But his parents don’ t buy them for\nhim. Why then does he refuse  when someone else\noffers them to him?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2 / Moments\n“Come, child, come,” called  his par ents, as he lagged behind,\nfascinated  by the toys in the shops that lined the way.\nHe hurried towar ds his par ents, his feet obedient to their call,\nhis eyes still lingering on the r eceding toys. As he came to wher e\nthey had stopped to wait for him, he could not suppr ess the desir e\nof his heart, even though he well knew the old, cold star e of refusal\nin their eyes.\n“I want that toy,” he pleaded.\nHis father looked at him r ed-eyed, in his familiar tyrant’s way.\nHis mother , melted by the fr ee spirit of the day was tender and,\ngiving him her finger to hold, said, “Look, child, what is befor e you!”\nIt was  a flowering mustar d-field, pale like melting gold as it\nswept acr oss miles and miles of even land.\nA group of dragon-flies wer e bustling about on their gaudy\npurple wings, inter cepting the flight of a lone black bee or butter fly\nin sear ch of sweetness fr om the flowers. The child followed them\nin the air with his gaze, till one of them would still its wings and\nrest, and he would try to catch it. But it would go fluttering,\nflapping, up into the air , when he had almost caught it in his\nhands. Then his mother gave a cautionary call: “Come, child,\ncome, come on to the footpath.”\nHe ran towar ds his par ents gaily and walked abr east of them\nfor a while, being, however , soon left behind, attracted by the\nlittle insects and wor ms along the footpath that wer e teeming out\nfrom their hiding places to enjoy the sunshine.\n“Come, child, come!” his par ents  called fr om the shade  of a\ngrove wher e they had seated themselves on the edge of a well. He\nran towar ds them.\nA shower of young flowers fell upon the child as he enter ed\nthe gr ove, and, for getting his par ents, he began to gather the\nraining petals in his hands. But lo! he hear d the cooing of  doves\nand ran towar ds his par ents, shouting, “The dove! The dove!” The\nraining petals dr opped fr om his for gotten hands.\n“Come, child, come!” they called to the child, who had now\ngone running in wild capers r ound  the banyan tr ee, and  gathering\nhim up they took the narr ow, winding footpath which led to the\nfair thr\nough the mustar d fields.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nThe Lost Child / 3\nAs they near ed the village the child could see many other\nfootpaths full of thr ongs, conver ging to the whirlpool of the fair ,\nand felt at once r epelled and fascinated by the confusion of the\nworld he was entering.\nA sweetmeat seller hawked, “ gulab-jaman, rasagulla, bur fi,\njalebi ,” at the cor ner of the entrance and a cr owd pr essed r ound\nhis counter at the foot of an ar chitectur e of many colour ed  sweets,\ndecorated with leaves of silver and gold. The child star ed open-\neyed and his mouth water ed for the burfi that was his favourite\nsweet. “I want that burfi,”  he slowly mur mured. But he half knew\nas he begged that his plea would not be heeded because his\nparents would say he was gr eedy. So without waiting for an answer\nhe moved on.\nA flower -seller hawked, “A garland of gulmohur , a garland of\ngulmohur !” The child seemed irr esistibly drawn. He went towar ds\nthe basket wher e the flowers lay heaped and half mur mured, “I\nwant that garland.” But he well knew his par ents would r efuse to\nbuy him those flowers because they would say that they wer e\ncheap. So, without waiting for an answer , he moved on.\nA man stood holding a pole with yellow, r ed, gr een and purple\nballoons flying fr om it. The child was simply carried away by the\nrainbow glory of their silken colours and he was filled with an\noverwhelming desir e to possess them all. But he well knew his\nparents would never buy him the balloons because they would\nsay he was too old to play with such toys. So he walked on farther .\nA snake-char mer stood playing a flute to a snake which coiled\nitself in a basket, its head raised in a graceful bend like the neck\nof a swan, while the music stole into its invisible ears like the\ngentle rippling of an invisible water fall. The child went towar ds\nthe snake-char mer. But, knowing his par ents had forbidden him\nto hear such coarse music as the snake-char mer played, he\nproceeded farther .\nThere was a r oundabout in full swing. Men, women and\nchildr en, carried away in a whirling motion, shrieked and cried\nwith dizzy laughter . The child watched them intently and then he\nmade a bold r equest: “I want to go on the r oundabout, please,\nFather , Mother .”\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n4 / Moments\nThere was no r eply. He tur ned to look at his par ents. They wer e\nnot ther e, ahead of him. He tur ned to look on either side. They\nwere not ther e. He looked behind. Ther e was no sign of them.\nA full, deep cry r ose within his dry thr oat and with a sudden\njerk of his body he ran fr om wher e he stood, crying in r eal fear ,\n“Mother , Father .” Tears r olled down fr om his eyes, hot and fier ce;\nhis flushed face was convulsed with fear . Panic-stricken, he ran\nto one side first, then to the other , hither and thither in all\ndirections, knowing not wher e to go. “Mother , Father ,” he wailed.\nHis yellow turban came untied and his clothes  became muddy.\nHaving run to and fr o in a rage of running for a while, he\nstood defeated, his cries suppr essed into sobs. At little distances\non the gr een grass he could see, thr ough his filmy eyes, men and\nwomen talking.  He tried to look intently among the patches of\nbright yellow clothes, but ther e was no sign of his father and\nmother among these people, who seemed to laugh and talk just\nfor the sake of laughing and talking.\nHe ran quickly again, this time to a shrine to which people\nseemed to be cr owding. Every little inch of space her e was\ncongested with men, but he ran thr ough people’s legs, his little\nsob lingering: “Mother , Father!” Near the entrance to the temple,\nhowever , the cr owd became very thick: men jostled each other ,\nheavy men, with flashing, mur derous eyes and hefty shoulders.\nThe poor child struggled to thrust a way between their feet but,\nknocked to and fr o by their brutal movements, he might have\nbeen trampled under foot, had he not shrieked at the highest\npitch of his voice, “Father , Mother!” A man in the sur ging cr owd\nheard his cry and, stooping with gr eat dif ficulty, lifted him up\nin his ar ms.\n“How did you get her e, child? Whose baby ar e you?” the man\nasked as he steer ed clear of the mass.  The child wept mor e\nbitterly than ever now and only cried, “I want my mother , I\nwant my father!”\nThe man tried to soothe him by taking him to the r oundabout.\n“Will you have a ride on the horse?” he gently asked as he\napproached the ring.  The child’s thr oat tor e into a thousand shrill\nsobs and he only shouted , “I want my mother , I want my father!”\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nThe Lost Child / 5\nThe man headed towar ds the place wher e the snake-char mer\nstill played on the flute to the swaying cobra. “Listen to that\nnice music, child!” he pleaded. But the child shut his ears with\nhis fingers and shouted his double-pitched strain: “I want my\nmother , I want my father!”  The man took him near the balloons,\nthinking the bright colours of the balloons would distract the\nchild’s attention and quieten him. “W ould you like a rainbow-\ncolour ed balloon?” he persuasively asked.  The child tur ned his\neyes fr om the flying balloons and just sobbed, “I want my mother ,\nI want my father!”\nThe man, still trying to make the child happy, bor e him to the\ngate wher e the flower -seller sat. “Look! Can you smell those nice\nflowers, child!  W ould you like a garland to put r ound your neck?”\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n6 / Moments\nThe child tur ned his nose away fr om the basket and r eiterated\nhis sob, “I want my mother , I want my father!”\nThinking to humour his disconsolate char ge by a gift of\nsweets, the man took him to the counter of the sweet shop.\n“What sweets would you like, child?” he asked. The child tur ned\nhis face fr om the sweet shop and only sobbed, “I want my\nmother , I want my father!”\nMULK RAJ ANAND\n1.What ar e the things the child sees on his way to the fair?\nWhy does he lag behind?\n2.In the fair he wants many things.
