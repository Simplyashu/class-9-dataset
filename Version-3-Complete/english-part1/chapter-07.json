R EACH FOR THE TOP\nThis unit has two biographical pieces that depict persistent endeavours to\nreach the top. Part II of this unit is taken fr om a newspaper . The language is\nvery current and idiomatic. An exercise of matching words and phrases to\ntheir meanings has been given as a pre-reading activity to facilitate students’\nunderstanding and appreciation of this part of the text.\nIn this unit students are asked to imagine that they have to give a speech.\nThey may wish to read the texts of well-known speeches such as Nehru’s\n‘Tryst with Destiny’. A speech is a formal use of spoken language. It must be\nprepared meticulously.\nThe language is formal but should be made powerful by the use of balance\n(“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your\ncountry.” — Kennedy), imagery (“The light has gone out of our lives” — Nehru)\nand other such rhetorical devices. It can be enriched by the use of examples\nand anecdotes.\nThe Writing task of composing an article for a school magazine can be prepared\nfor by looking at other examples of such articles in newspapers. This task\nmakes a beginning in helping students to write for the print media. Encourage\nthem to work within a given word limit (such as 500 words, or 1000 words),\nand to use everyday, contemporary language.\nHelp students to write a description of Santosh Y adav’s character by drawing\ntheir attention to her background, likes and dislikes, her humanity and her\ncontribution to society.\n8. K ATHMANDU\n‘Kathmandu’ is excerpted from Heaven Lake , a travelogue in which Vikram\nSeth gives an account of what he saw, thought and felt when he travelled from\nChina to T ibet, fr om Heaven Lake to the Himalayas.\nThe map reading activity and the activity on locating the possible routes (by\nroad, rail or air) from Kathmandu to different places in India are designed to\nlink the lesson to the outside world. Students may wish to consult brochures\nor travel guides, visit a  travel agency or call them on the telephone, speak to\npeople who have been to Nepal, and so on. This is a ‘communicative’ and\n‘authentic’ task.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nReach for the Top  / 83\nTo prepare for the second Speaking task, students can listen to cricket/\nfootball commentaries or eyewitness accounts of the Independence Day/\nRepublic Day parade in class or at home on radio or T.V.  Encourage them\nto observe the use of the language and follow the narration. Have a\ndiscussion in the class on the features of the commentary (its language, its\nliveliness, etc.)\n A diary can be an opportunity to write freely about our life and the things\nthat happen to us — funny, sad, happy, embarrassing or fear ful. W e also\nmake notes on places we visit or our encounters with people.\nThe Writing task suggests that diary entries can form the basis of a\ntravelogue, and asks students to imagine a journey to Kathmandu. It may be\nsupplemented by an actual travelogue-writing task given after a long holiday,\nor after a class trip out of the town.\n9. IF I WERE YOU\nThis one-act play is to be read aloud in class by assigning roles to students.\nDraw the students’ attention to the stage setting, stage directions, description\nof the characters, their movements, gestures and tonal variations, since these\ncombine to bring out the effect of the play.\nThe play has many examples of wit and irony. Two examples are given in an\nexercise. Y ou can add a few mor e for the students to have a clear understanding.\nThe dictionary task in this unit is to help children locate the right meaning\nfrom a dictionary for a word they come across while reading. The task draws\nstudents’ attention to ‘signposts’ such as parts of speech that help match use\nto meaning. Encourage the students to look at more entries in the dictionary\nand observe the meanings of words that occur as different parts of speech\n(adjective, noun, verb).\nNotes for the Teacher  / 83\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n84 / Beehive\nPart I\nSantosh Yadav\nB BBBBEFORE\nEFOREEFORE EFOREEFORE  Y  Y  Y  Y YOU OUOU OUOU R  R R  R READ EADEAD EADEAD\n•Think for a while and make a list of three to five persons you\nidolise, or admir e very much for their achievements.

When her mother\nwas expecting Santosh, a travelling\n‘holy man’, giving her his blessing,\nassumed that she wanted a son.\nBut, to everyone’s surprise, the\nunbor n child’s grandmother , who\nwas standing close by, told him that\nthey did not want a son. The ‘holy\nman’ was also surprised!\nNevertheless, he gave the requested\nblessing  ... and as destiny would\nhave it, the blessing seemed to work.\nSantosh was born the sixth child in\na family with five sons, a sister to7.

She was born in the small village of\nJoniyawas of Rewari District in Haryana.\n2.The girl was given the name ‘Santosh’, which means\ncontentment. But Santosh was not always content\nwith her place in a traditional way of life. She began\nliving life on her own terms from the start. Where\nother girls wore traditional Indian dresses, Santosh\npreferred shorts. Looking back, she says now, “From\nthe very beginning I was quite determined that if I\nchose a correct and a rational path, the others\naround me had to change, not me.”\n3.Santosh’s parents were affluent landowners who\ncould afford to send their children to the best\nschools, even to the country’s capital, New Delhi,\nwhich was quite close by. But, in line with the\nprevailing custom in the family, Santosh had to\nmake do with the local village school. So, she decided\nto fight the system in her own quiet way when\nthe right moment arrived. And the right moment\ncame when she turned sixteen. At sixteen, most of\nthe girls in her village used to get married.\nSantosh was also under pressure from her parents\nto do the same.\n4.A marriage as early as that was the last thing  on\nher mind. She threatened her parents that she\nwould never marry if she did not get a proper\neducation. She left home and got herself enrolled\nin a school in Delhi. When her parents refused to\npay for her education, she politely informed them\nof her plans to earn money by working part time to\npay her school fees. Her parents then agreed to pay\nfor her education.\n5.Wishing always to study “a bit more” and with her\nfather slowly getting used to her urge for more\neducation, Santosh passed the high school\nexaminations and went to Jaipur . She joined\nMaharani College and got a room in Kasturba Hostel.\nSantosh remembers, “Kasturba Hostel faced thethe last thing : the\nleast important thingin line with : following\nor in accordance\nwith; according to\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n86 / Beehive\nAravalli Hills. I used to watch villagers from my room,\ngoing up the hill and suddenly vanishing after a\nwhile. One day I decided to check it out myself. I\nfound nobody except a few mountaineers. I asked if\nI could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they\nanswered in the affirmative and motivated me to\ntake to climbing.”\n6.Then there was no looking back for this determined\nyoung girl. She saved money and enrolled in a\ncourse at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of\nMountaineering. “My college semester in Jaipur was\nto end in April but it ended on the nineteenth of\nMay. And I was supposed to be in Uttarkashi on\nthe twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead,\nI headed straight for the training. I had to write a\nletter of apology to my father without whose\npermission I had got myself enrolled at Uttarkashi.”\n7.Ther eafter , Santosh went on an\nexpedition every year . Her climbing\nskills matured rapidly. Also, she\ndeveloped a remarkable resistance to\ncold and the altitude. Equipped with\nan iron will, physical endurance and\nan amazing mental toughness, she\nproved herself repeatedly. The\nculmination of her hard work and\nsincerity came in 1992, just four years\nafter she had shyly asked the Aravalli\nmountaineers if she could join them.\nAt barely twenty years of age, Santosh\nYadav scaled Mt Ever est, becoming the\nyoungest woman in the world to\nachieve the feat. If her climbing skills,\nphysical fitness, and mental strength\nimpressed her seniors, her concern for\nothers and desire to work together with\nthem found her a special place in the\nhearts of fellow climbers.check it out : find out\n(the truth)\nIron will, physical endurance and\nmental toughness characterise\nSantosh Y adav.headed straight fo r:\nwent towards\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nReach for the Top  / 87\n8.During the 1992 Ever est mission, Santosh Y adav\nprovided special care to a climber who lay dying at\nthe South Col. She was unfortunately unsuccessful\nin saving him. However , she managed to save\nanother climber , Mohan Singh, who would have\nmet with the same fate had she not shared her\noxygen with him.\n9.Within twelve months, Santosh found herself a\nmember of an Indo-Nepalese W omen’s Expedition\nthat invited her to join them. She then scaled the\nEverest a second time, thus setting a record as the\nonly woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and\nsecuring for herself and India a unique place in the\nannals of mountaineering. In recognition\nof her achievements, the Indian government\nbestowed upon her one of the nation’s top honours,\nthe Padmashri.\n10.Describing her feelings when she was literally ‘on\ntop of the world’, Santosh has said, “It took some\ntime for the enormity of the moment to sink\nin... Then I unfurled the Indian tricolour and held it\naloft on the roof of the world. The feeling is\nindescribable. The Indian flag was flying on top of\nthe world. It was truly a spiritual moment. I felt\nproud as an Indian.”\nAlso a fervent environmentalist, Santosh collected\nand brought down 500 kilograms of garbage from\nthe Himalayas.\nThinking about the TThinking about the TThinking about the TThinking about the TThinking about the T e ee eextxtxt xtxt\nI.Answer these questions in one or two sentences each.

What does she like?\n–What motivates her to keep going?\n1.THERE  is something disarming about Maria\nSharapova, something at odds with her ready smile\nand glamorous attire. And that something in her\nlifted her on Monday, 22 August 2005 to the world\nnumber one position in women’s tennis. All this\nhappened in almost no time. Poised beyond her\nyears, the Siberian born teenager took just four\nyears as a professional to reach the pinnacle.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n90 / Beehive\n2.However , the rapid ascent in a fier cely competitive\nworld began nine years before with a level of\nsacrifice few children would be prepared to endure.\nLittle Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth\nbirthday when she was packed off to train in the\nUnited States. That trip to Florida with her father\nYuri launched her on the path to success and\nstardom. But it also required a heart-wrenching\ntwo-year separation fr om her mother Y elena. The\nlatter was compelled to stay back in Siberia because\nof visa r estrictions. The nine-year -old girl had\nalready learnt an important lesson in life — that\ntennis excellence would only come at a price.\n3.“I used to be so lonely,” Maria Sharapova recalls. “I\nmissed my mother terribly. My father was working\nas much as he could to keep my tennis-training\ngoing. So, he couldn’t see me either .\n4.“Because I was so young, I used to go to bed at\n8 p.m. The other tennis pupils would come in atMaria Sharapova won the women’s singles\nat Wimbledon in 2004\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nReach for the Top  / 91\n11 p.m. and wake me up and order me to tidy up\nthe room and clean it.\n5.“Instead of letting that depress me, I became more\nquietly determined and mentally tough.\nI learnt how to take care of myself. I never thought\nof quitting because I knew what I wanted. When\nyou come from nothing and you have nothing, then\nit makes you very hungry and determine d... I would\nhave put up with much more humiliation and insults\nthan that to steadfastly pursue my dream.”\n6.That toughness runs through Maria even today. It\nwas the key to her bagging the women’s singles crown\nat Wimbledon in 2004 and to her meteoric rise to\nthe world number one spot the following year .\n7.While her journey from the frozen plains of Siberia\nto the summit of women’s tennis has touched the\nhearts of tennis fans, for the youngster herself there\nappears to be no room for sentiment. The straight\nlooks and the answers she gives when asked about\nher ambition make it amply clear that she considers\nthe sacrifices were worth it. “I am very, very\ncompetitive. I work hard at what I do. It’s my job.”\nThis is her mantra for success.\n8.Though Maria Sharapova speaks with a pronounced\nAmerican accent, she proudly parades her Russian\nnationality. Clearing all doubts, she says, “I’m\nRussian. It’s true that the U.S. is a big part of my\nlife. But I have Russian citizenship. My blood is\ntotally Russian. I will play the Olympics for Russia\nif they want me.”\n9.Like any number of teenaged sensations, Maria\nSharapova lists fashion, singing and dancing as her\nhobbies. She loves reading the novels of Arthur Conan\nDoyle. Her fondness for sophisticated evening gowns\nappears at odds with her love of pancakes with\nchocolate spread and fizzy orange drinks.\n10.Maria Sharapova cannot be pigeon-holed or\ncategorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to\nsucceed and readiness to sacrifice  have lifted her\nto the top of the world. Few would grudge her the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n92 / Beehive\nriches she is now reaping. This is what she has to\nsay about her monetary gains from tennis:\n“Of course, money is a motivation.
