It is extremely important that learner-centric methodologies of language learning should be promoted for eliciting critical responses, and developing sensitivity to social issues.\nThe focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and \ncommunicative competence. Language learning progresses naturally with exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this context, importance has been attributed in the National Curriculum Framework–2005, to methods of teaching which are process based. These give opportunities to learners for engaging with texts and equip them for self-assessment.\nEnglish has been one of the languages which is being learnt in schools. \nIt is therefore recommended that English be learnt along with the language of the learners since it leads to transference of skills from the child’s own language to the second language (English).\nWe, at NCERT make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant and \nauthentic resources. This supplements and complements language acquisition, and provide opportunities for learners to associate experiences with everyday life. \nNCERT had developed two books, Beehive and Moments for Class IX, \nbased on the National Curriculum Framework\n – 2005. The workbook, Words \nand \nExpressions 1 is a sequential continuation of these. It has been developed \ntaking into account the feedback on these books and needs of learners and teachers. \nThe workbook has taken into account the skills that are critical for overall \ndevelopment of the learners, such as the skills of collaboration, creativity and imagination, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and compassion. \nWe hope this workbook will serve as an effective instrument for learners \nand teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning processes. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources and materials. All the publications of NCERT are regularly revised on the basis of the feedback from students, parents, teachers and teacher educators.  \nNew Delhi\n    HrusHikes H senapaty\nMay 2018       Director , NCERT\nPrelims.indd   3 20-02-2023   09:25:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\niv\nPrelims.indd   4 20-02-2023   09:25:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nvrationalisation  oF Content  in the textbooks  \nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content \nload on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the \nfollowing:\n•\tContent based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary \nreaders at different stages of school education\n•\tContent that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language\n\tproficiency \tand\tis\taccessible \tat\tdifferent \tstages\n•\tFor reducing \nthe curriculum load and examination stress in view of the \nprevailing condition of the Pandemic \n•\tContent, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning\n•\tContent, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out \nthe changes given above.\nPrelims.indd   5 20-02-2023   09:25:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nPrelims.indd   6 07-Feb-25   4:23:59 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nabout the workbook\nWords and Expressions 1, a sequence to the textbook in English for  \nClass IX, Beehive, is a self-study material. The main purpose of this workbook \nis to give learners exposure to further their skills in language in the context of their textbook. The passages and activities given here will enable them to handle English for performing important language functions and help them develop critical thinking on contemporary concerns. Grammar activities are presented in everyday contexts. The book is expected to serve as a basis for revisiting language learning.\n The 11 units in this workbook are not designed in isolation. The chapters \nof the textbook and the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The units correspond to each lesson in the textbook. Each unit starts with an ice-breaker — ‘Let’s begin’ followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary tasks, Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking and Writing activities. All units end with Project reiterating the learning through elaborate activities. The sections focus on a particular language skill.\n‘Let’s begin’ asks questions making the students think and discuss. \nThey are asked to collect information, read various written texts and  \ne-texts, watch and listen to online resources from Internet services like  \nYouTube. They are required to work in groups of two or four, jot down points, develop speech, debate etc. and then to speak before the whole class. This follows\n\tintegrated \tprocess\tof\treading\twith\tcomprehension, \treflection, \twriting\t\nand expressing thoughts. \nThe unseen comprehension passages are chosen based on the themes \nof the corresponding chapters. It has prose passages as well as poems. The familiarity of the context has been taken care of while \nselecting the \npassages. An attempt has been made to expose the learners to a variety of texts, comprehend the meaning of words in context, understand the theme, and answer factual and thought-provoking questions. Learners are also given opportunities to interpret poems, acquainted with beautiful expressions, phrases, and understand the expressions of the images. Some questions have been given to infer meaning, and some are to  \ninspire learners to think critically and bring out learners’ deeper understanding  \nof the text. \nA variety of tasks and exercises are placed strategically to build vocabulary  \nin\n\tthe\tgiven\tcontext. \tEven\tthough\tdifficult\twords\tare\tglossed\tin\tthe\tmargins, \t\nthe learners are encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The intention is to help them learn new words and their usages as well as new meanings of familiar words in different contexts. \nWritten and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions in peer \ngroups. \nThe themes of the composition include ICT and advanced technology; \ncontemporary issues like gender, environment; adolescent issues; social issues which are relevant to the age group and appropriate to the present time. This is to enable the learners to see the world, and develop necessary skills and face the challenges of the present as well as future. \nPrelims.indd   7 20-02-2023   09:25:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nviii\nGrammar activities are given with usage in focus, not the formal explication \nof grammatical concepts. The listening and speaking activities give the students \nenough opportunities to develop listening comprehension and to use English in real life situations. It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed simultaneously, not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. \nThe nuance of the workbook is that, it is directly addressed to the students; \nthe language used is simple, so that there is less dependence on the teachers.\nThe Project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to be \nengaging, cross-curricular and interdisciplinary. These help generate interest to explore, analyse and then present thoughts orally or in writing.   \nThe activities are simple and stress-free, enabling the learners to complete \nthem\n\tconfidently. \tSelf-learning \tis\tencouraged. \tThe\tpair\tor\tgroup\twork\twill\tgive\t\nstudents an opportunity to look at \nthe work of their peers and make each of  \nthem feel both responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique learning style. The group work may help them understand their challenges, evaluate themselves vis-à-vis\n\ttheir\tpeers\tand\tfind\ta\tbest\tway\tto\tovercome \t\nthem.  The teachers can scaffold if there is a need. Some Fun Facts are given in a box throughout the workbook, with a hope that the learner would have a lasting \nimpression of the correct usage. Teachers must remember that  \nFun Facts are to be taken in light spirit and are non  - evaluative.\nIt\tis\thoped\tthat\tthe\tlearners \twill\tfind\tthis\tworkbook \tenjoyable \tand\t\nrewarding. It is learner-centered and activity-based. The readers are welcome to comment and suggest on any aspect of the Words and Expressions 1 \ntowards \nits\trefinement.\nPrelims.indd   8 20-02-2023   09:25:12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nworkbook  development  Committee  \nChairperson\nSandhya Rani Sahoo, Professor, Department of Education in Languages, \nNCERT, New Delhi\nmembers\nDolly Dhawan, PGT (English), G.D.
