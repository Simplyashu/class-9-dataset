You must have heard or read about Poorna, who at the age of 13 years 11 months, became the youngest girl in the world to have scaled the Mount Everest in 2014, with sheer determination and willpower. You would have also read about Maria Sharapova who bagged the Women’s Singles crown at Wimbledon in 2004. She was determined, tough, competitive, hard-working with unwavering desire. Both of them had big dreams from the very young age. \n1.\n Do you have the passion \nto do something other than your studies like \nthese two icons have?

Paes ranked 31 places below the Brazilian, played with gusto and determination against a player who has two ATP tour titles under his belt, and clinched the bronze medal. He was given a standing gusto: enjoyment and \nenthusiasm\nUnit 7.indd   96 20-02-2023   09:25:57\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nUnit 797\novation when Paes raised his hand in triumph and said a \nsilent prayer.\nLeander’s father had won a bronze medal in the Munich \nOlympics \t1972\tas\ta\tmember \tof\tthe\tIndian\thockey\tteam.\tIt\tis\t\ncreditable to Leander Paes \nas he got it in an individual event.\nLater he dedicated the medal to his coach and his \ndoubles teammate. “They have helped me out and given me advice and kept me in good frame of mind. This medal doesn’t just show my efforts; it shows the efforts of the whole team.”\nPaes was recognised as a prodigy by Vijay Amritraj in \nthe ’80s. Even so, Paes’ true mentor has been Naresh Kumar, the\n\tformer\tIndian\tDavis\tCup\tCaptain. \tHis\tincredible \tDavis\t\nCup record speaks for itself. While it may be said that some of his Davis Cup victories \nwere achieved because he was \nplaying on his favourite surface, grass and enjoyed home support. But at Atlanta, Paes had none of these advantages except his coach, close family members and the expatriates. While Davis Cup victories bring in good cash rewards and ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) points, there he was playing for just a medal. Paes explains it all when he says,\n\t“When\tI\tam\tplaying\tfor\tmy\tcountry \tI\tdon’t\texpect\t\nanything.” That straightaway sets him apart.\nHe succeeds because of his willingness \nto take his \nchances, \tswift\treflexes\tand\tmental\tstrength, \tand\tthe\tfact\t\nthat he does not accept defeat easily.\n(Source: http://www.jhs.ac.in/pdf/Cbse-qp/Grade-9/English/5.pdf)\n1.\t Leander’s \tvictory\tat\tAtlanta\tis\tsignificant \tbecause \t\n____________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n2.\n His father’s Olympic triumph \nin 1972 was different \nfrom his own because it was\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________prodigy: a young person \nwith exceptional qualities or abilities\nexpatriate:  a person who \nlives outside their native \ncountry\nUnit 7.indd   97 20-02-2023   09:25:57\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n Words and ExprEssions  198\n3.

An idiomatic expression is a group of words with a \nspecial meaning. The individual words in the expression do not mean what they otherwise stand for.\nExample: Maria Sharapova cannot be ‘pigeon-holed’ or \ncategorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to succeed \nand readiness \nto sacrifice have lifted her to the top of \nthe world.\nHere pigeon-holed does not mean that there is a hole \nfor the pigeon to its nest. But it means that someone \nor something belongs to a particular type or group; is categorised, especially without knowing much about them.\nNow, consult a dictionary and match the following \nidiomatic expressions given in Column ‘A’ with their meanings in Column ‘B’.Contradictory proverbs\nDoubt is the beginning of wisdom.\nbutFaith will move mountains. \nGreat starts make great \nfinishes. \nbutIt isn’t over till it’s over. \nWise men think alike.\nbutFools seldom differ.

Listen to it carefully and answer the questions.\nHarvard-MIT \tresearcher, \tHugh\tHerr,\tis\tfamiliar \twith\t\nthe obstacles faced by \namputees. A world-class mountain \nclimber at the age of 17, Herr and a friend were trapped \nin a snowstorm while ascending New Hampshire’s Mount Washington in 1982. After three days without food or camping gear, the two were rescued, but frostbite cost Herr both his legs, which were amputated just below the knee. Herr was fitted with prostheses, but he soon discovered that they were developed for walking on flat surfaces, and not for taking on advanced functions like climbing or running. With the same determination that he once applied to climbing, he set out to create a better prosthetic leg. He worked with an engineering shop to fashion his own prostheses, tinkering with customised sockets and lighter materials. He even designed artificial feet specially made for climbing rock (built flat and narrow for getting a toehold in cracks and ice featuring sharp spikes).\n“I\n\texperienced \ta\ttremendous \tamount \tof\tpain\tfrom\t\nprosthetic \tlimbs\tat\tfirst”,\tHerr\tsays.\t“So\tI\tdecided\tto\tgo\tback\t\nto school and learn about physics and engineering to try to solve these problems.” Herr obtained a Master’s degree in mechanical\n\tengineering \tfrom\tMIT\tin\t1993\tand\ta\tdoctorate \t\nin\tbiophysics \tfrom\tHarvard \tfive\tyears\tlater.\nAfter struggling for \na decade to come up with a better \nprosthetic limb, just getting the knee to market will be a personal triumph for Herr\n  —  yet another mountain \nconquered. \t“It’s\tbeen\ta\tlong\troad”,\the\tsays.\t“But\tI\tthink\tI’m\t\nfinally\tin\ta\tposition \tto\tmake\ta\tdifference.”\n(Adapted from ‘Born to Run’, Evan Ratliff, Span, Sep.–Oct. 2002, \nSteps to English, Workbook for Class X, NCERT, 2003, p. 43)\n1.
