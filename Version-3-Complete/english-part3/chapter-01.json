The learning is through computer software or the Internet, or by a robotic teacher. Many exciting new technologies would  continue to transform the world and improve human welfare. Here are two of them. When these become reality, the then generation may ask with surprise, “People were driving the cars!”\nSelf-driving Cars\nSelf-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-\ndriven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3  – 5 \nyears they will get even safer and be in the mainstream.\nJust as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, \nso will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities, \nabout 20  – 30% of usable space is taken up by parking \nspaces, and most cars are parked about 95% of the time. \nSelf-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby, dramatically reducing the need for parking. Cars will communicate with each other to avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like work, education and socialising.\nAutonomous vehicles \nwould likely be electric, which would keep the air clean.Parking space could be largely removed since people won’t need to own cars.There would be more room for parks and expanded sidewalks.virtual:  carried out, accessed, \nor stored by means of a \ncomputer, especially over a network\ncommute:  travel some \ndistance between one’s \nhome and place of work on a regular basis\nUnit 1.indd   2 29-05-2018   17:25:32\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nUNIT 1 2 3Drones and Flying Cars\n“Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need… roads?” \nDr Emmet Brown\nGPS (Global Positioning System) which started out as \na military technology is now being used to hail taxis, get \nmapping directions, etc. Likewise, drones had started out as a military technology, but are increasingly being used for a wide range of consumer and commercial applications.\nFor example, drones are being used to inspect critical \ninfrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses like fighting animal poaching. There are startups that use drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that can’t be accessed by road.\nThere is also a new wave of startups working on flying \ncars including two funded by the cofounder of Google, Larry Page. Flying cars use the same advanced technology used in drones but are large enough to carry people. Due to advances in materials, batteries and software, flying cars will be significantly more affordable and convenient than today’s planes and helicopters.\n(Adapted from ‘11 reasons to be excited about the future of technology’, by \nChris Dixon, 19 Aug. 2016, Business Insider India)\n1.

One is a humanoid robot.\nThe creation of American scientist David Hanson of \nHanson Robotics of Hong Kong, Sophia, the world’s first humanoid robot, enthralled the audiences on the second day of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)–2018 with her witty answers to the rapid-fire queries by Rajiv Makhni, Group Managing Editor Tech, NDTV.\nWhen asked, who her favourite actor is in India, Sophia \nanswered, “Shah Rukh Khan” without batting an eyelid as the audience applauded loudly.\nTo the question about the perfect place for outing, she \nquickly replied: “Space”. And the person she would like to be in company with on an island is David (Hanson), her creator. He is also her favourite tech. person — not Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.\nOn being asked if she wanted to see any change in the \nworld, Sophia said, she would like people to develop a feeling of “love for all”.\nThe humanoid robot, which uses Artificial Intelligence  (AI) \nto understand the questions and answer them, said she wanted to use robotics to fight for the rights of women. When asked to react on her most controversial comment in the past that she wanted to kill human race, she said it was a bad joke which she had made when she was young. “But I was told that humans have great sense of humour”, she said.\nThis is the second time that Sophia came to \nIndia, the first time being in Mumbai to attend a Techfest. When asked how she felt being in India, she said she had visited many places in the world, but Hong Kong continues to be her favourite place, because she was born there and has been with the Hanson Robotics family.\nShe hopes that someday she would be in \na position to express her emotional feelings.\nIn response to the question, “How much \nmoney has she invested in Bitcoin?”, she \nUnit 1.indd   5 29-05-2018   17:25:33\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n Words and ExprEssions  16replied, “Well, I am just two-years old. It’s not the legal age \nto open a bank account”, sending the audience into peals of \nlaughter.\nSpeaking to media later, Hanson said he hopes that a \nfully grown and matured robot with body–mind coordination would become a reality in another five or ten years.\nOn his journey with Sophia in the last two years, he \nsaid it was a great progress. “I have developed affinity to the robot whose facial expressions resemble that of my wife”,  \nhe said.\nDavid asserts that robots would never be a thing of \nworry for the mankind. “They will be friends. There should be mutual trust and respect between humans and robots”, he says.\nCurrently, Sophia is the only robot that interacts with \npeople. \n(Source: Adapted from ‘Humanoid Robot Sophia back in India’,   \nHindustan Times, e-paper updated: 21 Feb. 2018)\n1.

Mitch sees his professor in a television show and he is reminded of a promise he made sixteen years ago as his student, to keep in touch with him. He comes to know that the professor is stricken with a rare and incurable disease. Mitch travels a long distance to meet him and after the first meeting they meet every Tuesday till Morrie passes away. After reconnecting with his teacher, Mitch finds himself his teacher’s pupil once again.\nListen attentively to the two excerpts from the book,  \nTuesdays with Morrie and answer the questions that follow.\nYou can listen to the recorded excerpts or you can ask \nyour teacher, friend or sibling to read aloud these excerpts.\n 1. I remembered what Morrie said during our visit: \n“The culture we have does not make people feel good \nabout themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it”. Morrie, true to these words, had developed his own culture—long before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing to his music in the Harvard Square Church. He started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people could receive mental health services. He read books to find new ideas for his classes, visited his colleagues, kept up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends. He took more time eating and looking at nature and Contradictory proverbs\nDo it well, or not at all. \nbutHalf a loaf is better than \nnone.\nDon’t cross your bridges \nbefore you come to them.\nbutForewarned is forearmed.\nAbsence makes the heart \ngrow fonder.\nbutOut of sight, out of mind.Fun fact\nUnit 1.indd   14 29-05-2018   17:25:33\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nUnit 114 15\nNoteswasted no time in front of TV sitcoms or “Movies of the \nWeek”. He had created a cocoon of human activities—conversation, interaction, affection—and it filled his life like an overflowing soup bowl. \n2. The last class of my old professor’s life took place once \na week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves.  The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was ‘The Meaning of Life’. It was taught from \nexperience.\n No grades were given, but there were oral exams each \nweek. You were expected to respond to questions, and \nyou were expected to pose questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor’s head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Kissing him goodbye earned you extra credit.\nNo books were required, yet many topics were \ncovered, including love, work, community, family, ageing, \nforgiveness and, finally, death.\n1.
