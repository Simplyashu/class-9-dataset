Y ou will notice that small str eams\nflowing from different directions come together\nto for m the main river , which ultimately drains\ninto a large water body such as a lake or a sea\nor an ocean. The area drained by a single river\nsystem is called a drainage basin . A closer\nobservation on a map will indicate that any\nelevated area, such as a mountain or an upland,\nseparates two drainage basins. Such an upland\nis known as a water divide  (Figure 3.1).\nFigure 3.2 : A GorgeDRAINAGE  SYSTEMS  IN INDIA\nThe drai nage systems of India are mainly\ncontrolled by the broad relief features of the\nsubcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers\nare divided into two major groups:\n•the Himalayan rivers; and\n•the Peninsular rivers.\nApart from originating from the two major\nphysiographic region s of India, the Himalayan\nand the Peninsular rivers are different from\neach other  in many ways . Most of the\nHimalayan rivers are perennial .  It means\nthat they have water thr oughout the year .\nThese rivers receive   water from rain as well\nas from melted snow from the lofty\nmountains. The two major Himalayan rivers,\nthe Indus and the Brahmaputra originate\nfrom the north of the mountain ranges. They\nhave cut through the mountains making\ngorges. The Himalayan rivers have long\ncourses from their source to the sea.3\nWater Divide\nSream ASream B\nFigur e 3.1 : W ater Divide\nThe world’s largest drainage\nbasin is of the Amazon river\n• Which river has the largest basin in India?Stream  AStream B\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n18 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-IThey perform intensive erosional activity in\ntheir upper courses and carry huge loads  of\nsilt and sand. In the middle and  the lower\ncourses, these rivers form meanders,  oxbow\nlakes, and many other depositional features\nin their floodplains. They also have well-\ndeveloped  deltas (Figure 3.3).\nA large number of the Peninsular rivers are\nseasonal, as their flow is dependent on rainfall.\nDuring the dry season, even the large rivers\nhave reduced flow of water in their channels.\nThe Peninsular rivers have shorter and\nshallower courses as compared to their\nHimalayan counterparts. However , some of\nthem originate in the central highlands and flow\ntowards the west. Can you identify two such\nlarge rivers? Most of the rivers of peninsular\nIndia originate in the W ester n Ghats and flow\ntowards the Bay of Bengal.\nSource of River\nUpper Course\nMiddle Course\nOx-Bow Lake\nLower\nCourseMeander\nDelta\nFigure 3.3 : Some Features Made by RiversThe Himalayan Rivers\nThe major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the\nGanga and the Brahmaputra. These rivers are\nlong, and are joined by many large and\nimportant tributaries. A river alongwith its\ntributaries may be called a river system.\nThe Indus River System\nThe river Indus rises in T ibet, near Lake\nMansar owar. Flowing west, it enters India in the\nLadakh . It forms a picturesque gorge in this\npart. Several tributaries, the Zaskar , the Nubra,\nthe Shyok  and \nthe Hunza , join it in the Kashmir\nregion. The Indus flows through Baltistan and\nGilgit and emerges from the mountains at Attock.\nThe Satl uj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and\nthe Jhelum join together to enter the Indus near\nMithankot in Pakistan. Beyond this, the Indus\nflows southwards eventually reaching the\nArabian Sea, ea st of Karachi.   The Indus plain\nhas a very gentle slope. With a total length of\n2900 km, the Indus is one of the longest rivers\nof the world. A little over a third of the Indus\nbasin is located in India Ladakh , Jammu and\nKashmir , Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the\nrest is in Pakistan.\n• According to the regulations\nof the Indus Water Treaty (1960) , India can\nuse only 20 per cent of the total water carried by\nthe Indus river system. This water is used for\nirrigation in Punjab, Haryana and the southern\nand the western parts of Rajasthan.\nThe Ganga River System\nThe headwaters of the Ganga, called the\n‘Bhagirathi’ is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and\njoined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in\nUttarakhand. At Haridwar , the Ganga emer ges\nfrom the mountains on to the plains.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nDRAINAGE 19Figure 3.4 : Major Rivers and Lakes\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n20 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I\nThe Ganga is joined by many tributaries\nfrom the Himalayas, a few of them being major\nrivers, such as the Y amuna, the Ghaghara, the\nGandak and the Kosi. The river Y amuna rises\nfrom the Y amunotri Glacier in the Himalayas.\nIt flows parallel to the Ganga and as a right\nbank tributary meets the Ganga at Allahabad.\nThe Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise\nin the Nepal Himalaya. They are the rivers,\nwhich flood parts of the northern plains every\nyear, causing widespr ead damage to life and\nproperty, whereas, they enrich the soil for\nagricultural use.\nThe main tributaries, which come from the\npeninsular uplands, are the Chambal, the\nBetwa and the Son. These rise from semi-arid\nareas, have shorter courses and do not carry\nmuch water in them. Find out where and how\nthey ultimately join the Ganga.Figure 3.5 : Confluence of Bhagirathi and Alaknanda at\nDevaprayag\n                         • The Namami Gange Programme\nis an Integrated Cons ervation Mission approved as\na ‘flagship programme’ by the Union Government\nin June 2014 to accomplish the twin objectives of\neffective abatement of pollution, conservation and\nrejuvenation of the national river , Ganga.  You may\nexplore about this project at http://nmcg.nic.in/\nNamamiGanga.sspx#\nEnlarged with the waters from its right and\nleft bank tributaries, the Ganga flows\neastwar ds till Farakka in W est Bengal. This isthe northernmost point of the Ganga delta. The\nriver bifurcates here; the Bhagirathi-Hooghly\n(a distributary) flows southwards through the\ndeltaic plains to the Bay of Bengal. The\nmainstream, flows southwards into\nBangladesh and is joined by the Brahmaputra.\nFurther downstream, it is known as the\nMeghna. This mighty river , with waters fr om\nthe Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into\nthe Bay of Bengal. The delta formed by these\nrivers is known as the \nSundarban Delta .\n• The Sundarban Delta derived\nits name from the Sundari tree, which grows well\nin marshland.\n•  It is the world’s largest and fastest growing delta.\nIt is also the home of Royal Bengal tiger .\nThe  length of the Ganga is over 2500 km.\nLook at Figure 3.4; can you identify the type of\ndrainage pattern formed by the Ganga river\nsystem? Ambala is located on the water divide\nbetween the Indus and the Ganga river systems.\nThe plains from Ambala to the Sunderban\nstretch over nearly 1800 km, but the fall in its\nslope is hardly 300 metres. In other words, there\nis a fall of just one metre for every 6 km.\nTherefore, the river develops large meanders.\nThe Brahmaputra River System\nThe Brahmaputra rises in T ibet east of\nMansaro war lake very close to the sources of\nthe Indus and the Satl uj. It is slightly longer\nthan the Indus, and most of its course lies\noutside India. It flows eastwards parallel to\nthe Himalayas. On reaching the Namcha\nBarwa (7757 m), it takes a ‘U’ turn and enters\nIndia in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge.\nHere, it is called the Dihang and it is joined by\nthe Dibang, the Lohit, and many other\ntributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam.\n•  Brahmaputra is know n as\nthe Tsang Po in Tibet and Jamuna in Bangladesh.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nDRAINAGE 21In Tibet, the river carries a smaller volume of\nwater and less silt as it is a cold and a  dry area.\nIn India , it passes through a region of high\nrainfall. Here the river carries a large volume of\nwater and considerable amount of silt. The\nBrahmaputra has a braided channel in its entire\nlength in Assam  and forms many riverine islands.\nDo you rem ember the name of the world’s largest\nriverine island formed by the Brahmaputra?\nEvery year during the rainy season, the\nriver overflows its banks, causing widespread\ndevastation due to floods in Assam and\nBangladesh. Unlike other north Indian river s,\nthe Brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits\nof silt on its bed causing  the riverbed to rise.\nThe river also shifts its channel frequently.\nThe Peninsular Rivers\nThe main water divide in Peninsular India is\nformed by the W estern Ghats, which runs fr om\nnorth to south close to the western coast.  Most\nof the major rivers of the Peninsula ,\n such as\nthe Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and\nthe Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the\nBay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at\ntheir mouths. There are numerous small\nstreams flowing west of the W ester n Ghats.\nThe Narmada and the Tapi are the only long\nrivers, which flow west  and make esturies.   The\ndrainage basins of the peninsular rivers are\ncomparatively  small er in size.\nThe Nar mada Basin\nThe Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills\nin Madhya Pradesh. It flows towards the west\nin a rift valley formed due to faulting. On its\nway to the sea, the Narmada creates many\npicturesque locations. The ‘Marble rocks’,\nnear Jabalpur , wher e the Nar mada flows\nthrough a deep gorge, and the ‘Dhuadhar\nfalls, where the river plunges over steep rocks,\nare some of the notable ones.               • The Narmada river\nconservation mission has been undertaken by the\ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh by a scheme named\nNamami Devi Nar made. You may visit their website.\nhttp://www.namamidevinarmade.mp.gov.in to\nlearn more about it.\nAll tributaries of the Narmada are very short\nand most of these join the main stream at right\nangles. The Narmada basin covers parts of\nMadhya Pradesh and Gujarat.\nThe Tapi Basin\nThe Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges, in the\nBetul district of Madhya Pradesh. It also flows\nin a rift valley parallel to the Narmada but it is\nmuch shorter in length. Its basin covers parts\nof Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\nThe coastal plains between W estern Ghats\nand the Arabian Sea are very narrow. Hence,\nthe coastal rivers are short. The main west\nflowing rivers are Sabarmati, Mahi,\nBharathpuzha and Periyar . Find out the states\nin which these rivers drain the water .\nThe Godavari Basin\nThe Godavari is the lar gest Peninsular river . It\nrises fr om the slopes of the W estern Ghats in\nthe Nasik district of Maharashtra. Its length is\nabout 1500 km.  It drains into the Bay of Bengal.\nIts drainage basin is also the largest among the\npeninsular rivers. The basin covers parts of\nMaharashtra (about 50 per cent of the basin\narea lies in Maharashtra), Madhya Pradesh,\nOdisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Godavari is\njoined by a number of tributaries, such as the\nPurna, the W ardha, the Pranhita, the Manjra,\nthe W ainganga and the Penganga.  The last thr ee\ntributaries are very large. Because of its length\nand the area it covers, it is also known as the\nDakshin Ganga .\nThe Mahanadi Basin\nThe Mahanadi rises in the highlands of\nChhattisgarh. It flows through Odisha to reach\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n22 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-Ithe Bay of Bengal. The length of the river is\nabout 860 km. Its drainage basin is shared by\nMaharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,\nand Odisha.\nThe Krishna Basin\nRising fr om a spring near Mahabaleshwar , the\nKrishna flows for about 1400 km and reaches\nthe Bay of Bengal. The Tungabhadra, the\nKoyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the\nBhima are some of its tributaries.  Its drainage\nbasin is shared by Maharasthra, Karnataka\nand Andhra Pradesh.\nThe Kaveri Basin\nThe Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the\nWestern Ghats and it r eaches the Bay of Bengal\nin south of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. The total\nlength of the river is about 760 km.  Its main\ntributaries are Amravati, Bhavani, Hemavati\nand Kabini. Its basin drains parts of Karnataka,\nKerala and Tamil Nadu.\n•  The river Kaveri makes the\nsecond biggest waterfall in India , known as\nShivasamudram Falls. The hydroelectric power\ngenerated from the falls is supplied to Mysuru ,\nBengaluru  and the Kolar Gold Field.\n•  The name of the biggest waterfall\nin India.\nBesides these major rivers, there are some\nsmaller rivers flowing towards the east. The\nDamoder , the Brahmani, the Baitar ni and the\nSubarnrekha are some notable examples.\nLocate them in your atlas.\n• 71 per cent of the world’s\nsurface is cover ed with water , but 97 per cent of\nthat is salt water .\n• Of the 3 per cent that is available as fr eshwater ,\nthree quarters of it is trapped as ice.\nLAKES\nYou may be familiar with the valley of Kashmir\nand the famous Dal Lake, the house boats and\nshikaras , which attract thousands of tourists\nevery year . Similarly, you may have visited\nsome other tourist spot near a lake and enjoyed\nboating, swimming and other water games.Imagine that if Srinagar , Nainital and other\ntourists places did not have a lake  would they\nhave been as attractive as they are today? Have\nyou ever tried to know the importance of lakes\nin  making a place attractive to tourists ?  Apart\nfrom attraction for tourists , lakes are also useful\nto human beings in many ways.\n• Lakes of large extent are called seas,\nlike the Caspian, the Dead and the Aral seas.\nIndia has many lakes. These differ from\neach other in size and other characteristics.\nMost lakes are permanent ; some contain water\nonly during the rainy season, like the lakes in\nthe basins of inland drainage of semi-arid\nregions. There are some lakes which are the\nresult of the action of glaciers and ice sheets,\nwhile others have been formed by wind, river\naction and human activities.\nA meandering river across a floodplain\nforms cut-offs  that later develops into  ox-bow\nlakes. Spits and bars form lagoons in the\ncoastal areas, e.g. the Chilika lake, the Pulicat\nlake and the Kolleru lake. Lakes in the region\nof inland drainage are sometimes seasonal; for\nexample, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which\nis a salt water lake. Its water is used for\nproducing salt.\nMost of the freshwater lakes are in the\nHimalayan region.  They are of glacial origin.\nIn other words, they  formed when glaciers\ndug out a basin, which was later filled with\nsnowmelt. The W ular lake in Jammu and\nKashmir , in contrast, is the r esult of  tectonic\nactivity.  It is the largest freshwater lake in\nIndia.  The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak\nand Barapani are some other important\nfreshwater lakes.\nFigure 3.6 : Loktak Lake\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nDRAINAGE 23\nApart from natural lakes, the damming of\nthe rivers for the generation of hydel power has\nalso led to the formation of lakes, such as Guru\nGobind Sagar (Bhakra Nangal Project).\nActivity\nMake a list of natural and artificial\nlakes with the help of the atlas.\nLakes are of great value to human beings.\nA lake helps to r egulate the flow of a river .\nDuring heavy rain s, it prevents flooding and\nduring the dry season, it helps to maintain\nan even flow of water . Lakes can also be used\nfor developing hydel power . They moderate the\nclimate of the surroundings; maintain the\naquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty,\nhelp develop tourism and provide recreation.\nROLE OF RIVERS IN THE ECONOMY\nRivers have been of fundamental importance\nthroughout the human history. W ater fr om\nrivers is a basic natural resource, essential\nfor various human activities. Therefore,\nriverbanks have attracted settlers from ancient\ntimes. These settlements have now become big\ncities. Make a list of cities in your state which\nare located on the bank of a river .\nUsing rivers for irrigation, navigation,\nhydro -power generation  is of special\nsignificance  — particularly to a country like\nIndia, where agriculture is the major source\nof  livelihood of the majority of its population.\nRIVER POLLUTION\nThe growing domestic, municipal, industrial\nand agricultural demand for water from rivers\nnaturally af fects the quality of water . As aresult, more and more water is being drained\nout of the rivers reducing their volume. On the\nother hand, a heavy load of untreated sewage\nand industrial effluents are emptied into the\nrivers. This affects not only the quality of water\nbut also the self-cleansing capacity of the river .\nFor example, given the adequate streamflow,\nthe Ganga water is able to dilute and assimilate\npollution loads within 20 km of large cities.\nBut the increasing urbanisation and\nindustrialisation do not allow it to happen and\nthe pollution level of many rivers has been\nrising. Concern over rising pollution in our\nrivers led to the launching of various action\nplans to clean the rivers. Have you heard about\nsuch action plans? How does our health get\naffected by polluted river water? Think about\n“life of human beings without fresh water”.\nArrange a debate on this topic in the class.National River Conservation Plan\n(NRCP)\nThe river cleaning programme in the\ncountry was initiated with the launching\nof the Ganga Action Plan (GAP)\nin 1985. The Ganga Action Plan was\nexpanded to cover other rivers under the\nNational River Conservation Plan\n(NRCP) in the year 1995. The objective\nof the NRCP is to improve the water\nquality of the rivers, which are major\nwater sources in the country, through\nthe implementation of pollultion\nabatement work.\nSource:  http://nrcd.nic.in/nrcp.pd as on\n25.07.17\n1.Choose the right answer from the four alternatives given below.\n(i)In which of the following states is the Wular lake located?\n(a)Rajasthan (c)Punjab\n(b)Uttar Pradesh (d)Jammu and KashmirEXERCISE\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n24 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I(ii)The river Narmada has its source at\n(a)Satpura (c)Amarkantak\n(b)Brahmagiri (d)Slopes of the W ester n Ghats\n(iii) Which one of the following lakes is a salt water lake?\n(a)Sambhar (c)Wular\n(b)Dal (d)Gobind Sagar\n(iv) Which one of the following is the longest river of the Peninsular India?\n(a)Narmada (c)Godavari\n(b)Krishna (d)Mahanadi\n(v)Which one amongst the following rivers flows through a rift valley?\n(a)Mahanadi (c)Krishna\n(b)Tungabhadra (d)Tapi\n2.Answer the following questions briefly.\n(i)What is meant by a water divide?
