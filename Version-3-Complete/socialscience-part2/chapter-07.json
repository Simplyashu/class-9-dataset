This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Including creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory\ngroup in Social Sciences, Pr ofessor Hari V asudevan and the Chief Advisor for\nthis book, Professor M. H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful\nto their principals for making this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions\nand organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their\nresour ces, material and personnel.  W e are especially grateful to the members\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nof the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department\nof Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource\nDevelopment under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and\nProfessor G.P .

In this\nbackground, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks\nacross all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes\nhave been taken into consideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n•Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n•Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n•Difficulty level\n•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-\nlearning\n•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given\nabove.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTEXTBOOK  DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE\nCHAIRPERSON , ADVISORY  COMMITTEE  FOR TEXTBOOKS  IN SOCIAL SCIENCE  AT THE\nSECONDARY  LEVEL\nHari V asudevan , Professor , Department of History, University of Calcutta,\nKolkata\nCHIEF ADVISOR\nM.
