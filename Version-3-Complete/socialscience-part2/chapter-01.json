It has achieved multi-faceted socio-\neconomic progress during the last five\ndecades .  It has moved forward displaying\nremarkable progress in the field of\nagriculture, industry, technology and overall\neconomic development.  India has also\ncontributed significantly to the making of\nworld  history.\nLOCATION\nIndia is a vast country.

From Figure 1.2 it is clear\nthat India is the seventh largest country of\nthe world.  India has a land boundary of\nabout 15,200 km and the total length of the\ncoas tline of the mainland , including\nAndaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep ,\nis 7,516.6 km.\nIndia is bounded by the young fold\nmountains in the northwest,  north and\nnortheast. South of about 22° north\nlatitude, it begins to taper , and extends\ntowards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into\ntwo seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and\nthe Bay of  Bengal on its east.\nLook at Figure 1.3 and note that the\nlatitudinal and longitudinal extent of the\nmainland is about 30°. Despite this fact , the\neast-west extent appears to be smaller than\nthe north-south extent.\nFrom Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh ,\nthere is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time\nalong the Standard Meridian of India\n(82°30'E) passing through Mirzapur (in\nUttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time\nfor the whole country. The latitudinal extent\ninfluences the duration of day and night, as\none moves from south to north.•Why 82°30'E has been selected as the Standard\nMeridian of India ?\n•Why is the difference between the durations\nof day and night hardly felt at Kanniyakumari\nbut not so in Kashmir?\nI\nNDIA AND THE WORLD\nThe Indian landmass has a central location\nbetween the East and the W est Asia. India is a\nsouthward extension of the Asian continent. The\ntrans Indian Ocean routes , which connect the\ncountries of Eur ope in the W est and the\ncountries of  East Asia , provide a strategic central\nlocation to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula\nprotrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping\nIndia to establish close contact with W est Asia,\nAfrica and Europe from the western coast and\nwith Southeast and East Asia from the eastern\ncoast. No other country has a long coastline on\nthe Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is\nIndia’s eminent position in the Indian Ocean ,\nwhich justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.\nFigur e 1.2 : Seven Lar gest Countries of the W orldSource : United Nations Demographic Y ear Book 2015Since the opening of the\nSuez Canal in 1869, India’s distance from Europe\nhas been reduced by 7,000 km.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nINDIA – SIZE AND LOCATION 3Figure 1.3 :  India : Extent and Standard Meridian\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nCONTEMPORARY INDIA-I 4Figur e 1.4 :  India on Inter national Highway of T rade and Commer ce\n•  The number of Union Territories\nalong the western and eastern coasts.\n•  Area-wise which is the smallest and which is\nthe largest state?\n•  The states which do not have an international\nborder or lie on the coast.\n•  Classify the states into four groups each\nhaving common frontiers with\n(i) Pakistan, (ii) China, (iii) Myanmar , and\n(iv) Bangladesh.\nIndia shares its land boundaries with\nPakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest,\nChina (T ibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north\nand Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east.\nOur southern neighbours across the sea\nconsist of the two island countries, namelyIndia’s contacts with the W orld have\ncontinued through ages but her relationships\nthrough the land routes are much older than\nher maritime contacts. The various passes across\nthe mountains in the north have provided\npassages to the ancient travellers , while the\noceans restricted such interaction for a long time.\nThese routes have contributed in the\nexchange of ideas and commodities since\nancient times. The ideas of the Upanishads\nand the Ramayana , the stories of Panchtantra ,\nthe Indian numerals and the decimal system\nthus could reach many parts of the world. The\nspices, muslin and other merchandise were\ntaken from India to different countries. On the\nother hand, the influence of Greek sculpture,\nand the architectural styles of d ome and\nminar ets from W est Asia can be seen in\ndifferent parts of our country.\nINDIA’S NEIGHBOURS\nIndia occupies an important strategic position\nin South Asia. India has 28 states and Eight\nUnion Territories (Figure 1.5).Before 1947, there were two\ntypes of states in India — the provinces and the\nPrincely states.  Provinces were ruled directly by\nBritish officials , who were appointed by the\nViceroy. Princely states were ruled by local,\nhereditary rulers, who acknowledge d sovereignity\nin return for local autonomy.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nINDIA – SIZE AND LOCATION 5\nFigure 1.5 :  India and Adjacent Countries\nSri Lanka and Maldives.
