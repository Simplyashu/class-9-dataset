This\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home\nand community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy of Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning\nand to pursue imaginative activities and questions.  W e must r ecognise that,\ngiven space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging\nwith the information passed on to them by adults.  Treating the prescribed\ntextbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other\nresources and sites of learning are ignored.  Inculcating creativity and\ninitiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching.  The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress\nor boredom.  Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different\nstages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available\nfor teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving\nhigher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,\ndiscussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining ( NCER T)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book.  W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory\ngroup in languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor for\nthis book, Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the work of this committee.\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook ; we are\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\ngrateful to their principals for making this possible.  We are indebted to\nthe institutions and organi sations which have generously permitted us to\ndraw upon their r esour ces, materials and personnel. W e are especially\ngrateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed\nby the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human\nResource Development under the Chair person ship of Professor Mrinal Miri\nand Pr ofessor G.P . Deshpande for their valuable time and contribution.\nAs an organi sation committed to systemic reform and continuous\nimprovement in the quality of its pr oducts, NCER T welcomes comments\nand suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision\nand refinements.\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 December 2005 Research and Training\niv\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nRATIONALISATION  OF CONTENT  IN THE TEXTBOOKS\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on\nstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncr\neative mindset. In this backgr ound, the NCER T has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCER T acr oss classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n•Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and\nsupplementary readers at different stages of school education\n•Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing\nlanguage proficiency and is accessible at different stages\n•For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of\nthe prevailing condition of the Pandemic\n•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-lear ning or peer -learning\n•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes\ngiven above.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTEXTBOOK  DEVELOPMENT\nCOMMITTEE\nCHAIRPERSON , ADVISORY  GROUP IN LANGUAGES\nProfessor Namwar Singh, formerly Chairman, School of Languages,\nJawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi\nCHIEF ADVISOR\nR.
