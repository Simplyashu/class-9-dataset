The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in\ncomprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum,\nmultilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for\nmeaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and\naccuracy.\nCare has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process\nof teaching and lear ning. Lear ner-friendly language has been used in\nthe instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the\nchild. In this pr ocess the teacher is a facilitator or a co-lear ner.\nA rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,\ncultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from\nchildhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to\nmusic, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.\nThe range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and\ncognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres\nsuch as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;\ntravelogue; and the one-act play.\nThe number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this\ngreat source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and\nunderstand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include\ndifferent types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous\npoem.\nThe poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms\nof language and thought. W e need not talk about the poet or the\nbackground to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it.  Nor\nshould we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should\nencourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They\nshould be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory,\nthe tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand\nthe suggestiveness of the images.\nAn attempt has been made to help the learner develop the skill of\npredicting and anticipating what follows. Every good reader should guess\nwhat is coming next. The task ‘Befor e You Read’ given at the beginning\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nof each unit is designed for this purpose. Learners should be encouraged\nto participate in this activity.\nThe section ‘Thinking about the Text’ attempts to move from surface\nlevel understanding of the text to critical thinking. The comprehension\nexercises given here try to help the learners infer meaning. There are a\nfew questions which ask for the readers’ judgment; they aim to  bring\nout the learners’ deeper understanding of the text.\nIn the section ‘Thinking about Language’:\n•Vocabulary enrichment has been attempted thr ough a variety of\ntasks on the usage of words closely related in meaning, matching\nwords to meanings, word building (including phrasal verbs), and\nreference to the dictionary. An activity on the use of the index has\nbeen included.\n•Attention has been drawn to grammar -in-context that emer ges out of\nthe reading text, e.g. the use of the tenses and voice, reported speech,\nconditional and subordinate clauses or phrases, and adverbs.\nThe communicative skills have been exercised by tasks on Speaking\nand W riting. The Speaking tasks call for lear ners to work in pairs or\ngroups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint,\nexpress contrasts, seek or give an opinion, intr oduce a speaker , tell a\nstory, enact or read out a play in parts, etc.\nThere are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an\narticle for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration,\ndescription, and picture interpretation.\nA small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing\nout similarities and differences. Opportunities for writing in groups and\npairs are provided to get into the task.\nWe have intr oduced the old exer cise of dictation again but fr om a\ncompletely different perspective. Dictation has been introduced in its\ncurrent, updated form as a variety of activities designed to integrate the\nlanguage skills of listening, prior reading, language processing and recall,\nand writing, including the appropriate use of punctuation in meaningful\ncontexts.\nSome exercises also allow scope for the learners’ languages to support\none another’s by asking for reflection on relevant words, or poems or\nstories in other languages; and attempt (preliminary as they may be) to\nattend to the process of translation. Activities have been suggested to\nbring out the relatedness of the learners’ school subjects.\n2 / Beehive\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nUnits 1–3 Units 1–3Units 1–3Units 1–3Units 1–3\n1. T HE FUN THEY HAD\nThis story takes us to the world of the future where computers will play\na major role. Let the children talk freely about how they imagine the\nschools of the futur e that their own childr en might go to. Y ou might want\nto explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term\n‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a\n‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is\nthrough computer software or the Internet. The children may know what\na robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.\nIn this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.\nThe following points could be explained before the task.\n•A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers\nto show skill and ability in arguing.\n•A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose,\nwhich can be spoken for or against.\n•To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it.  So, one must\nprepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is\ngoing to argue.\n•The time limit is about four to five minutes.\n•The speaker addresses the audience.\n•Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary.  These must be learnt.\n•The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’\nan argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support,\n‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument.\n2. T HE SOUND OF MUSIC\nThese biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success\nand recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The\nchildren may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of\npeople who have overcome them. The second part of the unit encourages\nstudents to think about the rich heritage of Indian music, and our musical\ninstruments. The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be\nsupplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class.\nA comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in\nthe text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events,\nplaces, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers.\nDictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words. Children\nneed help in using the dictionary to find specific kinds of information.\nNotes for the Teacher  / 3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nThis unit has an exercise that asks students to consult a dictionary and\nfind out which adjective can be used before a noun, which can be used\nafter a verb, and which can be used in both ways. Y ou may add some\nadjectives to those suggested. Encourage the children also to find more\nadjectives of the kinds mentioned. Students may wish to consult (in\naddition to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary ), the Longman\nDictionary of Contemporary English , the Collins Cobuild  Advanced Learner’s\nEnglish Dictionary , and the Word Master  (Orient Longman), or any good\ndictionary of their choice.\nThe Speaking exercise asks the students to imagine introducing a\ncelebrity guest to an audience. It can be made an authentic activity if\nstudents are given a couple of minutes during the morning assembly to\nspeak to their fellow-pupils about such a person. This would give them\npractice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously,\nby: (i)  noting down the important points about the person to be\nintroduced, (ii) using appropriate phrases to introduce the person\n(students should be allowed to think what phrases they want to use).\nThe W riting T ask is an exer cise in comparison. Har d work is a trait common\nto Evelyn Glennie ( Part I, para 5) and Bismillah Khan ( Part II, para 5).\nHelp children identify the paragraphs that tell us about the two musicians’\ngoals. After they read and understand these parts of the text, they can\norgani se the ideas in two paragraphs, one on each musician.\n3. THE  LITTLE GIRL\nThe aim in this unit is to first read through the story at one go, not worrying\nabout difficult words or difficult language. Students can read the story for\nhomework and come to class; or the teacher can read out the story in\nclass; or the students can read out parts of the story in the class, one\nafter the other . Let them r etell the story again, if necessary, in parts.\nThe dictionary exercise in this unit shows how a very small common\nword can be used in different ways. Students might be interested in\nthinking about how they use words in their own language to express\nthese meanings. They may also think of other words like same , small ,\ngive and take to convey different kids of meaning. Encourage them to\nconsult a dictionary.\nThis is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her\nfather . The Speaking and W riting exer cises encourage the students to\nthink about the relationship between children and parents. The students\nshould be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the\nteacher thinks they should say or write.  The aim is not to arrive at\na ‘corr ect’ answer , but to let every child voice an opinion and expr ess\nher/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal\nrelevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely.\n4 / Beehive\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nB BB BBEFORE EFOREEFOREEFOREEFORE  Y  Y  Y  Y YOU OUOU OUOU R  R R  R READ EADEAD EADEAD\n•The story we shall read is set in the future, when books and\nschools as we now know them will perhaps not exist.

Margie’s grandfather once\nsaid that when he was a little boy his grandfather1. The F 1. The F1. The F 1. The F1.

And then\nwhen they turned back to the page before, it had\nthe same words on it that it had had when they\nread it the first time.\n2.“Gee,” said Tommy, “what a waste. When you’re\nthrough with the book, you just throw it away, I\nguess. Our television screen must have had a million\nbooks on it and it’s good for plenty more. I wouldn’t\nthrow it away.”\n“Same with mine,” said Margie. She was eleven\nand hadn’t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had.\nHe was thirteen.\nShe said, “Where did you find it?”\n“In my house.” He pointed without looking,\nbecause he was busy reading. “In the attic.”\n“What’s it about?”\n“School.”\n3.Margie was scornful. “School? What’s there to write\nabout school? I hate school.”\nMargie always hated school, but now she hated\nit mor e than ever . The mechanical teacher had been\ngiving her test after test in geography and she had\nbeen doing worse and worse until her mother had\nshaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County\nInspector .\n4.He was a round little man with a red face and a\nwhole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled\nat Margie and gave her an apple, then took the\nteacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn’t know\nhow to put it together again, but he knew how all\nright, and, after an hour or so, there it was again,\nlarge and black and ugly, with a big screen on which\nall the lessons were shown and the questions were\nasked. That wasn’t so bad.

She always had to write them out\nin a punch code they made her learn when she was\nsix years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated\nthe marks in no time.\n5.The Inspector had smiled after he was finished and\npatted Mar gie’s head. He said to her mother , “It’s\nnot the little girl’s fault, Mrs Jones. I think the\ngeography sector was geared a little too quick. Those\nthings happen sometimes. I’ve slowed it up to an\naverage ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern\nof her progress is quite satisfactory.” And he patted\nMargie’s head again.\nMargie was disappointed. She had been hoping\nthey would take the teacher away altogether . They\nhad once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a\nmonth because the history sector had blanked out\ncompletely.\nSo she said to Tommy, “Why would anyone write\nabout school?”\n6.Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes.\n“Because it’s not our kind of school, stupid. This is\nthe old kind of school that they had hundreds and\nhundreds of years ago.” He added loftily,\npronouncing the word carefully, “Centuries ago.”\nMargie was hurt. “W ell, I don’t know what\nkind of school they had all that time ago.” She read\nthe book over his shoulder for a while, then said,\n“Anyway, they had a teacher .”loftily : in a superior\nwayslot: a given space,\ntime or position\ngeared  (to) : adjusted\nto a particular\nstandard or level\nThey had a teache r...

How could a man be a teacher?”\n“Well, he just told the boys and girls things and\ngave them homework and asked them questions.”\n7.“A man isn’t smart enough.”\n“Sure he is. My father knows as much as my\nteacher .”\n“He knows almost as much, I betcha.”\nMargie wasn’t prepared to dispute that. She said,\n“I wouldn’t want a strange man in my house to\nteach me.”\nTommy scr eamed with laughter . “You don’t know\nmuch, Margie. The teachers didn’t live in the\nhouse. They had a special building and all the\nkids went there.”\n“And all the kids learned the same thing?”\n“Sure, if they were the same age.”\n8.“But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to\nfit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that\neach kid has to be taught differently.”\n“Just the same they didn’t do it that way then.\nIf you don’t like it, you don’t have to read the book.”\n“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Margie said quickly.\nShe wanted to read about those funny schools.\nThey weren’t even half finished when Margie’s\nmother called, “Margie! School!”\nMargie looked up. “Not yet, Mamma.”\n“Now!” said Mrs Jones. “And it’s probably time\nfor Tommy, too.”\nMargie said to Tommy, “Can I read the book some\nmore with you after school?”\n9.“May be,” he said nonchalantly. He walked away\nwhistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath\nhis arm.\nMargie went into the schoolroom. It was right\nnext to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher\nwas on and waiting for her . It was always on at the\nsame time every day except Saturday and Sunday,betcha (informal) :\n(I) bet you (in fast\nspeech): I’ m sure\ndispute:  disagree\nwith\nnonchalantly : not\nshowing much\ninterest or\nenthusiasm;\ncarelesslyregular : here,\nnormal; of the usual\nkind\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nThe Fun They Had  / 9\nbecause her mother said little girls learned better\nif they learned at regular hours.\nThe screen was lit up, and it said: “Today’s\narithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper\nfractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the\nproper slot.”\n10.Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about\nthe old schools they had when her grandfather’s\ngrandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the\nwhole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting\nin the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom,\ngoing home together at the end of the day. They\nlearned the same things, so they could help one\nanother with the homework and talk about it.\nAnd the teachers were people…\nThe mechanical teacher was flashing on the\nscreen: “When we add fractions ½ and ¼ ...”\nMargie was thinking about how the kids must\nhave loved it in the old days.

Sentences with unless or if not are negative conditional\nsentences.\nNotice that these sentences have two parts. The part that begins with if not or\nunless tells us the condition. This part has a verb in the present tense (look at\nthe verbs don’t finish, finish  in the sentences above).\nThe other part of the sentence tells us about a possible result. It tells us what\nwill happen  (if something else doesn’t happen). The verb in this part of the\nsentence is in the future tense (you’ll feel /you will fee l).\nNotice these two tenses again in the following examples.\nFuture Tense Present Tense\n•There won’t be any books left unless we preserve them.\n•You won’t lear n your lessons if you don’t study regularly.\n•Tommy will have an accident unless he drives more slowly.\nComplete the following conditional sentences.
