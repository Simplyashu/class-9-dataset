Then x = 2m +1 for some natural number m and\ny = 2n + 1 for some natural number n.\nx + y = 2 ( m + n + 1). Therefore, x + y is divisible by 2 and is even.\n4.See Q.3. xy = (2m + 1)(2 n + 1) = 2 (2 mn + m + n) + 1.\nTherefore, x y is not divisible by 2, and so it is odd.\n5.Let 2 n, 2n + 2 and 2 n + 4 be three consecutive even numbers.

Therefore, the six digit number \nabcabc  is divisible by 7, 11\nand 13.\nEXERCISE A2.1\n1.Step 1:  Formulation :\nThe relevant factors are the time period for hiring a computer , and the two costs given\nto us. We assume that there is no significant change in the cost of purchasing or\nhiring the computer . So, we treat any such change as irrelevant. We also treat all\nbrands and generations of computers as the same, i.e. these differences are also\nirrelevant.\nThe expense of hiring the computer for x months is ` 2000 x.  If this becomes more than\nthe cost of purchasing a computer , we will be better of f buying a computer .  So, the\nequation is\n2000 x= 25000 (1)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n218 MATHEMA TICS\nStep 2 :  Solution : Solving (1), x = 25000\n2000 = 12.5\nStep 3 :  Interpr etation :  Since the cost of hiring a computer becomes more after  12.5\nmonths, it is cheaper to buy a computer , if you have to use it for more than 12 months.\n2.Step1 :  Formulation : We will assume that cars travel at a constant speed. So, any\nchange of speed will be treated as irrelevant. If the cars meet after x hours, the first car\nwould have travelled a distance of 40 x km from A and the second car would have\ntravelled 30 x km, so that it will be at a distance of (100 – 30 x) km from A. So the\nequation will be 40 x = 100 – 30 x, i.e., 70 x = 100.\nStep 2 :  Solution : Solving the equation, we get x = 100\n70.\nStep 3 :  Interpr etation : 100\n70 is approximately 1.4 hours.  So, the cars will meet after\n1.4 hours.\n3.Step 1:Formulation : The speed at which the moon orbits the earth is\nLength of the orbit\nTime taken.\nStep 2 :  Solution :  Since the orbit is nearly circular , the length is 2 × π × 384000 km\n= 2411520 km\nThe moon takes 24 hours to complete one orbit.\nSo, speed = 2411520\n24 = 100480 km/hour .\nStep 3 :  Interpr etation : The speed is 100480 km/h.\n4.Formulation : An assumption is that the dif ference in the bill is only because of using\nthe water heater .\nLet the average number of hours for which the water heater is used = x\nDifference per month due to using water heater = ` 1240 – ` 1000 = ` 240\nCost of using water heater for one hour = ` 8\nSo, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = 8 × 30 × x\nAlso, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = Difference in bill due to using\nwater heater\nSo, 240x =240\nSolution : From this equation, we get x = 1.\nInterpr etation : Since x = 1, the water heater is used for an average of 1 hour in a day .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nANSWERS /HINTS 219\nEXERCISE A2.2\n1.We will not discuss any particular solution here.
