Your neighbour\ndecides one day to fence of f his land. After\nhe has fenced his land, you discover that a\npart of your family’ s land has been enclosed\nby his fence. How will you prove to your\nneighbour that he has tried to encroach on\nyour land? Your first step may be to seek the\nhelp of the village elders to sort out the\ndifference in boundaries. But, suppose opinion\nis divided among the elders. Some feel you are right and others feel your neighbour is\nright. What can you do? Your only option is to find a way of establishing your claim for\nthe boundaries of your land that is acceptable to all. For example, a government\napproved survey map of your village can be used, if necessary in a court of law , to\nprove (claim) that you are correct and your neighbour is wrong.\nLet us look at another situation. Suppose your mother has paid the electricity bill\nof your house for the month of August, 2005. The bill for September , 2005, however ,\nclaims that the bill for August has not been paid. How will you disprove the claim\nmade by the electricity department? You will have to produce a receipt proving that\nyour August bill has been paid.\nYou have just seen some examples that show  that in our daily life we are often\ncalled upon to prove that a certain statement or claim is true or false.  However , we\nalso accept many statements without bothering to prove them. But, in mathematics\nwe only accept a statement as true or false (except for some axioms) if it has been\nproved to be so, according to the logic of mathematics.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n168 MATHEMA TICS\nIn fact, proofs in mathematics have been in existence for thousands of years, and\nthey are central to any branch of mathematics. The first known proof  is believed to\nhave been given by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales.  While\nmathematics  was central to many ancient civilisations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, China\nand India, there is no clear evidence that they used proofs the way we do today .\nIn this chapter , we will look at what a statement is, what kind of reasoning is\ninvolved in mathematics, and what a mathematical proof consists of.\nA1.2 Mathematically Acceptable Statements\nIn this section, we shall try to explain the meaning of a mathematically acceptable\nstatement. A ‘statement’  is a sentence which is not an order or an exclamatory sentence.\nAnd, of course, a statement is not a question! For example,\n“What is the colour of your hair?”  is not a statement, it is a question.\n“Please go and bring me some water .”  is a request or an order , not a statement.\n“What a marvellous sunset!” is an exclamatory remark, not a statement.\nHowever , “The colour of your hair is black” is a statement.\nIn general, statements can be one of the following:\n•always true\n•always false\n•ambiguous\nThe word ‘ambiguous’ needs some explanation.  There are two situations which\nmake a statement ambiguous. The first situation is when we cannot decide if the\nstatement is always true or always false. For example, “T omorrow is Thursday” is\nambiguous, since enough of a context is not given to us to decide if the statement is\ntrue or false.\nThe second situation leading to ambiguity is when the statement is subjective, that\nis, it is true for some people and not true for others.  For example, “Dogs are intelligent”\nis ambiguous because some people believe this is true and others do not.\nExample 1 :  State whether the following statements are always true, always false or\nambiguous. Justify your answers.\n(i) There are 8 days in a week.\n(ii) It is raining here.\n(iii) The sun sets in the west.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 169\n(iv) Gauri is a kind girl.\n(v) The product of two odd integers is even.\n(vi) The product of two even natural numbers is even.\nSolution :\n(i) This statement is always false, since there are 7 days in a week.\n(ii) This statement is ambiguous, since it is not clear where ‘here’ is.\n(iii) This statement is always true. The sun sets in the west no matter where we live.\n(iv) This statement is ambiguous, since it is subjective–Gauri may be kind to some\nand not to others.\n(v) This statement is always false. The product of two odd integers is always odd.\n(vi) This statement is always true. However , to justify that it is true we need to do\nsome work. It will be proved in Section A1.4.\nAs mentioned before, in our daily life, we are not so careful about the validity of\nstatements. For example, suppose your friend tells you that in July it rains everyday in\nManantavadi, Kerala. In all probability , you will believe her , even though it may not\nhave rained for a day or two in July . Unless you are a lawyer , you will not ar gue with\nher!\nAs another example, consider statements we\noften make to each other like “it is very hot today”.\nWe easily accept such statements because we know\nthe context even though these statements are\nambiguous. ‘It is very hot today’ can mean different\nthings to different people because what is very hot\nfor a person from Kumaon may not be hot for a person\nfrom Chennai.\nBut a mathematical statement cannot be ambiguous. In mathematics, a statement\nis only acceptable or valid, if it is either tr ue or false. We say that a statement is\ntrue, if it is always true otherwise it is called a false statement.\nFor example, 5 + 2 = 7 is always true, so ‘5 + 2 = 7’ is a true statement and\n5 + 3 = 7 is a false statement.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n170 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 2 :  State whether the following statements are true or false:\n(i)The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.\n(ii)Every odd number greater than 1 is prime.\n(iii)For any real number x, 4x + x = 5x.\n(iv)For every real number x, 2x > x.\n(v)For every real number x, x2 ≥ x.\n(vi)If a quadrilateral has all its sides equal, then it is a square.\nSolution :\n(i)This statement is true. You have already proved this in Chapter 6.\n(ii)This statement is false; for example, 9 is not a prime number .\n(iii)This statement is true.\n(iv)This statement is false; for example, 2 × (–1) = –2, and –2 is not greater than –1.\n(v)This statement is false; for example, 1\n2\n\n=21\n4, and 1\n4 is not greater than 1\n2.\n(vi)This statement is false, since a rhombus has equal sides but need not be a square.\nYou might have noticed that to establish that a statement is not true according to\nmathematics, all we need to do is to find one case or example where it breaks down.\nSo in (ii), since 9 is not a prime, it is an example that shows that the statement “Every\nodd number greater than 1 is prime” is not true. Such an example, that counters a\nstatement, is called a counter -example.  We shall discuss counter -examples in greater\ndetail in Section A1.5.\nYou might have also noticed that while Statements (iv), (v) and (vi) are false, they\ncan be restated with some conditions in order to make them true.\nExample 3 :  Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that\nthey become true statements.\n(i)For every real number x, 2x > x.\n(ii)For every real number x, x2 ≥ x.\n(iii)If you divide a number by itself, you will always get 1.\n(iv)The angle subtended by a chord of a circle at a point on the circle is 90 °.\n(v)If a quadrilateral has all its sides equal, then it is a square.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 171\nSolution :\n(i)If x > 0, then 2 x > x.\n(ii)If x ≤ 0 or x ≥ 1, then  x2 ≥ x.\n(iii)If you divide a number except zero by itself, you will always get 1.\n(iv)The angle subtended by a diameter of a circle at a point on the circle is 90 °.\n(v)If a quadrilateral has all its sides and interior angles equal, then it is a square.\nEXERCISE A1.1\n1.State whether the following statements are always true, always false or ambiguous.\nJustify your answers.\n(i)There are 13 months in a year .\n(ii)Diwali falls on a Friday .\n(iii)The temperature in Magadi is 260 C.\n(iv)The earth has one moon.\n(v)Dogs can fly .\n(vi)February has only 28 days.\n2.State whether the following statements are true or false. Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 350°.\n(ii)For any real number x, x2 ≥ 0.\n(iii)A rhombus is a parallelogram.\n(iv)The sum of two even numbers is even.\n(v)The sum of two odd numbers is odd.\n3.Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that they become\ntrue statements.\n(i)All prime numbers are odd.\n(ii)Two times a real number is always even.\n(iii)For any x, 3x +1 > 4.\n(iv)For any x, x3 ≥ 0.\n(v)In every triangle, a median is also an angle bisector .\nA1.3 Deductive Reasoning\nThe main logical tool used in establishing the truth of an unambiguous  statement is\ndeductive r easoning. To understand what deductive reasoning is all about, let us\nbegin with a puzzle for you to solve.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n172 MATHEMA TICS\nYou are given four cards. Each card has a number printed on one side and a letter\non the other side.\nSuppose you are told that these cards follow the rule:\n“If a card has an even number on one side, then it has a vowel on the other side.”\nWhat is the smallest number of cards you need to turn over to check if the rule\nis true?\nOf course, you have the option of turning over all the cards and checking. But can\nyou manage with turning over a fewer number of cards?\nNotice that the statement mentions that a card with an even number on one side\nhas a vowel on the other . It does not state that a card with a vowel on one side must\nhave an even number on the other side. That may or may not be so. The rule also does\nnot state that a card with an odd number on one side must have a consonant on the\nother side. It may or may not.\nSo, do we need to turn over ‘A ’? No! Whether there is an even number or an odd\nnumber on the other side, the rule still holds.\nWhat about ‘5’? Again we do not need to turn it over , because whether there is a\nvowel or a consonant on the other side, the rule still holds.\nBut you do need to turn over V and 6. If V has an even number on the other side,\nthen the rule has been broken. Similarly , if 6 has a consonant on the other side, then the\nrule has been broken.\nThe kind of reasoning we have used to solve this puzzle is called deductive\nreasoning . It is called ‘deductive’ because we arrive at (i.e., deduce or infer) a result\nor a statement from a previously established statement using logic. For example, in the\npuzzle above, by a series of logical arguments we deduced that we need to turn over\nonly V and 6.\nDeductive reasoning also helps us to conclude that a particular statement is true,\nbecause it is a special case of a more general statement that is known to be true. For\nexample, once we prove that the product of two odd numbers is always odd, we can\nimmediately conclude (without computation) that 70001 × 134563 is odd simply because\n70001 and 134563 are odd.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 173\nDeductive reasoning has been a part of human thinking for centuries, and is used\nall the time in our daily life. For example, suppose the statements “The flower Solaris\nblooms, only if the maximum temperature is above 28 ° C on the previous day” and\n“Solaris bloomed in Imaginary Valley on 15th September , 2005” are true. Then using\ndeductive reasoning, we can conclude that the maximum temperature in Imaginary\nValley on 14th September , 2005 was more than 28° C.\nUnfortunately we do not always use correct reasoning in our daily life! We often\ncome to many conclusions based on faulty reasoning. For example, if your friend does\nnot smile at you one day , then you may conclude that she is angry with you.  While it\nmay be true that “if she is angry with me, she will not smile at me”, it may also be true\nthat “if she has a bad headache, she will not smile at me”. Why don’t you examine\nsome conclusions that you have arrived at in your day-to-day existence, and see if\nthey are based on valid or faulty reasoning?\nEXERCISE A1.2\n1.Use deductive reasoning to answer the following:\n(i)Humans are mammals. All mammals are vertebrates.  Based on these two\nstatements, what can you conclude about humans?\n(ii)Anthony is a barber . Dinesh had his hair cut. Can you conclude that Antony cut\nDinesh’ s hair?\n(iii)Martians have red tongues. Gulag is a Martian. Based on these two statements,\nwhat can you conclude about Gulag?\n(iv)If it rains for more than four hours on a particular day , the gutters will have to be\ncleaned the next day . It has rained for 6 hours today . What can we conclude\nabout the condition of the gutters tomorrow?\n(v)What is the fallacy in the cow’ s reasoning in the cartoon below?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n174 MATHEMA TICS\n2.Once again you are given four cards. Each card has a number printed on one side and\na letter on the other side. Which are the only two cards you need to turn over to check\nwhether the following rule holds?\n“If a card has a consonant on one side, then it has an odd number on the other side.”\nA1.4 Theor ems, Conjectur es and Axioms\nSo far we have discussed statements and how to check their validity . In this section,\nyou will study how to distinguish between the three different kinds of statements\nmathematics is built up from, namely , a theorem, a conjecture and an axiom.\nYou have already come across many theorems before.  So, what is a theorem? A\nmathematical statement whose truth has been established (proved) is called a theor em.\nFor example, the following statements are theorems, as you will see in Section A1.5.\nTheor em A1.1 :  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180º.\nTheor em A1.2 :  The pr oduct of two even natural numbers is even.\nTheor em A1.3 :  The pr oduct of any thr ee consecutive even natural numbers is\ndivisible by 16.\nA conjectur e is a statement which we believe is true, based on our mathematical\nunderstanding and experience, that is, our mathematical intuition. The conjecture may\nturn out to be true or false. If we can prove it, then it becomes a theorem.\nMathematicians often come up with conjectures by looking for patterns and making\nintelligent mathematical guesses. Let us look at some patterns and see what kind of\nintelligent guesses we can make.\nExample 4 :  Take any three consecutive even numbers and add them, say ,\n2 + 4 + 6 = 12, 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, 6 + 8 + 10 = 24, 8 +10 + 12 = 30, 20 + 22 +  24 = 66.\nIs there any pattern you can guess in these sums? What can you conjecture about\nthem?\nSolution :  One conjecture could be :\n(i)the sum of three consecutive even numbers is even.\nAnother could be :\n(ii)the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by 6.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 175\nExample 5 :  Consider the following pattern of numbers called the Pascal’ s Triangle:\nLine                   Sum of numbers\n1                                            1                                                    1\n2 1 1             2\n3      1      2       1             4\n4 1\n3 3 1             8\n5       1       4         6          4        1           16\n6 1 5        10 10 5 1           32\n7 : :             :\n8 : :             :\nWhat can you conjecture about the sum of the numbers in Lines 7 and 8? What\nabout the sum of the numbers in Line 21? Do you see a pattern? Make a guess about\na formula for the sum of the numbers in line n.\nSolution :  Sum of the numbers in Line 7 = 2 × 32 = 64 = 26\nSum of the numbers in Line 8 = 2 × 64 = 128 = 27\nSum of the numbers in Line 21 = 220\nSum of the numbers in Line n = 2n –1\nExample 6 :  Consider the so-called triangular numbers Tn:\nFig. A1.1\nThe dots here are arranged in such a way that they form a triangle. Here T1 = 1,\nT2 = 3, T3 = 6, T4 = 10, and so on.  Can you guess what T5 is? What about T6? What\nabout Tn?T1T2T3T4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n176 MATHEMA TICS\nMake a conjecture about Tn.\nIt might help if you redraw them in the following way .\nFig. A1.2\nSolution : T5 =1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = 5 6\n2×\nT6 =1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 = 6 7\n2×\nTn =n n× +( ) 1\n2\nA favourite example of a conjecture that has been open (that is, it has not been\nproved to be true or false) is the Goldbach conjecture named after the mathematician\nChristian Goldbach (1690 –1764).  This conjecture states that “ every even integer\ngreater than 4 can be expr essed as the sum of two odd primes .”  Perhaps you will\nprove that this result is either true or false, and will become famous!\nYou might have wondered – do we need to prove everything we encounter in\nmathematics, and if not, why not?\nT1T2T3T4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 177\nThe fact is that every area in mathematics is based on some statements which are\nassumed to be true and are not proved. These are ‘self-evident truths’ which we take\nto be true without proof. These statements are called axioms . In Chapter 5, you would\nhave studied the axioms and postulates of Euclid. (W e do not distinguish between\naxioms and postulates these days.)\nFor example, the first postulate of Euclid states:\nA straight line may be drawn fr om any point to any other point.\nAnd the third postulate states:\nA circle may be drawn with any centr e and any radius.\nThese statements appear to be perfectly true and Euclid assumed them to be true.\nWhy? This is because we cannot prove everything and we need to start somewhere.\nWe need some statements which we accept as true and then we can build up our\nknowledge using the rules of logic based on these axioms.\nYou might then wonder why we don’ t just accept all statements to be true when\nthey appear self-evident. There are many reasons for this. Very often our intuition can\nbe wrong, pictures or patterns can deceive and the only way to be sure that something\nis true is to prove it.  For example, many of us believe that if a number is multiplied by\nanother , the result will be lar ger than both the numbers. But we know that this is not\nalways true: for example, 5 × 0.2 = 1, which is less than 5.\nAlso, look at the Fig. A1.3. Which line segment is longer , AB or CD?\nFig. A1.3\nIt turns out that both are of exactly the same length, even though AB appears\nshorter!\nYou might wonder then, about the validity of axioms. Axioms have been chosen\nbased on our intuition and what appears to be self-evident. Therefore, we expect them\nto be true. However , it is possible that later on we discover that a particular axiom is\nnot true. What is a safeguard against this possibility? We take the following steps:\n(i)Keep the axioms to the bare minimum. For instance, based on only axioms\nand five postulates of Euclid, we can derive hundreds of theorems.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n178 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii)Make sure the axioms are consistent.\nWe say a collection of axioms is inconsistent,  if we can use one axiom to\nshow that another axiom is not true. For example, consider the following two\nstatements. We will show that they are inconsistent.\nStatement1: No whole number is equal to its successor .\nStatement 2: A whole number divided by zero is a whole number .\n(Remember , division by zer o is not defined . But just for the moment, we\nassume that it is possible, and see what happens.)\nFrom Statement 2, we get 1\n0 = a , where a is some whole number . This\nimplies that, 1 = 0. But this disproves Statement 1, which states that no whole\nnumber is equal to its successor .\n(iii)A false axiom will, sooner or later , result in a contradiction. We say that there\nis a contradiction, when we find a statement such that, both the statement\nand its negation ar e true. For example, consider Statement 1 and Statement\n2 above once again.\nFrom Statement 1, we can derive the result that 2 ≠ 1.\nNow look at x2 – x2. We will factorise it in two dif ferent ways as follows:\n(i)x2 – x2 = x(x – x) and\n(ii)x2 – x2 = (x + x)(x – x)\nSo, x(x – x) = (x + x)(x – x).\nFrom Statement 2, we can cancel ( x – x) from both sides.\nWe get x = 2x, which in turn implies 2 = 1.\nSo we have both the statement 2 ≠ 1 and its negation, 2 = 1, true. This is a\ncontradiction. The contradiction arose because of the false axiom, that a whole number\ndivided by zero is a whole number .\nSo, the statements we choose as axioms require a lot of thought and insight. We\nmust make sure they do not lead to inconsistencies or logical contradictions.  Moreover ,\nthe choice of axioms themselves, sometimes leads us to new discoveries. From Chapter\n5, you are familiar with Euclid’ s fifth postulate and the discoveries of non-Euclidean\ngeometries. You saw that mathematicians believed that the fifth postulate need not be\na postulate and is actually a theorem that can be proved using just the first four\npostulates. Amazingly these attempts led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries.\nWe end the section by recalling the dif ferences between an axiom, a theorem and\na conjecture. An axiom  is a mathematical statement which is assumed to be true\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 179\nwithout proof; a conjecture  is a mathematical statement whose truth or falsity is yet\nto be established; and a theorem  is a mathematical statement whose truth has been\nlogically established.\nEXERCISE A1.3\n1.Take any three consecutive even numbers and find their product; for example,\n2 × 4 × 6 = 48, 4 × 6 ×  8 = 192, and so on. Make three conjectures about these products.\n2.Go back to Pascal’ s triangle.\nLine 1 : 1 = 110\nLine 2 :  1  1 = 111\nLine 3 : 1  2  1 = 112\nMake a conjecture about Line 4 and Line 5. Does your conjecture hold? Does your\nconjecture hold for Line 6 too?\n3.Let us look at the triangular numbers (see Fig.A1.2) again. Add two consecutive\ntriangular numbers. For example, T1 + T2 = 4, T2 + T3 = 9, T3+ T4 = 16.\nWhat about T4 + T5 ?  Make a conjecture about Tn–1 +Tn.\n4.Look at the following pattern:\n12 = 1\n112 = 121\n1112 = 12321\n11112 = 1234321\n111112 = 123454321\nMake a conjecture about each of the following:\n1111112 =\n11111112 =\nCheck if your conjecture is true.\n5.List five axioms (postulates) used in this book.\nA1.5 What is a Mathematical Proof?\nLet us now look at various aspects of proofs. We start with understanding the dif ference\nbetween verification and proof. Before you studied proofs in mathematics, you were\nmainly asked to verify statements.\nFor example, you might have been asked to verify with examples that “the product\nof two even numbers is even”. So you might have picked up two random even numbers,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n180 MATHEMA TICS\nsay 24 and 2006, and checked that 24 × 2006 = 48144 is even. You might have done so\nfor many more examples.\nAlso, you might have been asked as an activity to draw several triangles in the\nclass and compute the sum of their interior angles. Apart from errors due to\nmeasurement, you would have found that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\n180°.\nWhat is the flaw in this method? There are several problems with the process of\nverification.  While it may help you to make a statement you believe is true, you cannot\nbe sure that it is true in all cases. For example, the multiplication of several pairs of\neven numbers may lead us to guess that the product of two even numbers is even.\nHowever , it does not ensure that the product of all pairs of even numbers is even. You\ncannot physically check the products of all possible pairs of even numbers. If you did,\nthen like the girl in the cartoon, you will be calculating the products of even numbers\nfor the rest of your life. Similarly , there may be some triangles which you have not yet\ndrawn whose interior angles do not add up to 180°. W e cannot measure the interior\nangles of all possible triangles.\n, evenAt age 8 At age 16\nAt age 36 At age 86, even , even\n, even\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 181\nMoreover , verification can often be misleading. For example, we might be tempted\nto conclude from Pascal’ s triangle (Q.2 of Exercise A1.3), based on earlier verifications,\nthat 1 15 = 15101051. But in fact 1 15 =161051.\nSo, you need another approach that does not depend upon verification for some\ncases only . There is another approach, namely ‘proving a statement’.  A process\nwhich can establish the truth of a mathematical statement based purely on logical\narguments is called a mathematical pr oof.\nIn Example 2 of Section A1.2, you saw that to establish that a mathematical\nstatement is false, it is enough to produce a single counter-example. So while it is not\nenough to establish the validity of a mathematical statement by checking or verifying\nit for thousands of cases, it is enough to produce one counter -example to dispr ove a\nstatement (i.e., to show that something is false). This point is worth emphasising.\nTo show that a mathematical statement is false, it is enough to find a single\ncounter-example.\nSo, 7 + 5 = 12 is a counter-example to the statement that the sum of two odd\nnumbers is odd.\nLet us now look at the list of basic ingredients in a proof:\n(i)To prove a theorem, we should have a rough idea as to how to proceed.\n(ii)The information already given to us in a theorem (i.e., the hypothesis) has to\nbe clearly understood and used.\nGirls don’t\nclimb trees.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n182 MATHEMA TICS\nFor example, in Theorem A1.2, which states that the product of two even\nnumbers is even, we are given two even natural numbers. So, we should use\ntheir properties. In the Factor Theorem (in Chapter 2), you are given a\npolynomial p(x) and are told that p(a) = 0. You have to use this to show that\n(x – a) is a factor of p(x). Similarly , for the converse of the Factor Theorem,\nyou are given that ( x – a) is a factor of p(x), and you have to use this hypothesis\nto prove that p(a) =0.\nYou can also use constructions during the process of proving a theorem.\nFor example, to prove that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°, we\ndraw a line parallel to one of the sides through the vertex opposite to the side,\nand use properties of parallel lines.\n(iii)A proof is made up of a successive sequence of mathematical statements.\nEach statement in a proof is logically deduced from a previous statement in\nthe proof, or from a theorem proved earlier , or an axiom, or our hypothesis.\n(iv)The conclusion of a sequence of mathematically true statements laid out in a\nlogically correct order should be what we wanted to prove, that is, what the\ntheorem claims.\nTo understand these ingredients, we will analyse Theorem A1.1 and its proof. You\nhave already studied this theorem in Chapter 6. But first, a few comments on proofs in\ngeometry . We often resort to diagrams to help us prove theorems, and this is very\nimportant. However , each statement in the proof has to be established using only\nlogic . Very often, we hear students make statements like “Those two angles are\nequal because in the drawing they look equal” or “that angle must be 900, because the\ntwo lines look as if they are perpendicular to each other”. Beware of being deceived\nby what you see (remember Fig A1.3)! .\nSo now let us go to Theorem A1.1.\nTheor em A1.1 :  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.\nProof :  Consider a triangle ABC (see Fig. A1.4).\nWe have to prove that ∠ ABC + ∠ BCA  + ∠ CAB = 180° (1)\nFig A 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 183\nConstruct a line DE parallel to BC passing through A. (2)\nDE is parallel to BC and AB is a transversal.\nSo, ∠ DAB and ∠ ABC are alternate angles. Therefore, by Theorem 6.2, Chapter 6,\nthey are equal, i.e. ∠ DAB = ∠ ABC (3)\nSimilarly , ∠ CAE = ∠ ACB (4)\nTherefore,  ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE (5)\nBut  ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°, since they form a straight angle. (6)\nHence,  ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = 180°. (7)\nNow , we comment on each step of the proof.\nStep 1 :  Our theorem is concerned with a property of triangles, so we begin with a\ntriangle.\nStep 2 :  This is the key idea – the intuitive leap or understanding of how to proceed so\nas to be able to prove the theorem. Very often geometric proofs require a construction.\nSteps 3 and 4 :  Here we conclude that ∠ DAE = ∠ ABC and ∠ CAE = ∠ ACB, by\nusing the fact that DE is parallel to BC (our construction), and the previously proved\nTheorem 6.2, which states that if two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal,\nthen the alternate angles are equal.\nStep 5 :  Here we use Euclid’ s axiom (see Chapter 5) which states that: “If equals are\nadded to equals, the wholes are equal” to deduce\n∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE.\nThat is, the sum of the interior angles of the triangle are equal to the sum of the angles\non a straight line.\nStep 6 :  Here we use the Linear pair axiom of Chapter 6, which states that the angles\non a straight line add up to 180°, to show that ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°.\nStep 7 :  We use Euclid’ s axiom which states that “things which are equal to the same\nthing are equal to each other” to conclude that ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC +\n∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°. Notice that Step 7 is the claim made in\nthe theorem we set out to prove.\nWe now prove Theorems A1.2 and A1.3 without analysing them.\nTheor em A1.2 :  The pr oduct of two even natural numbers is even.\nProof :   Let x and y be any two even natural numbers.\nWe want to prove that xy is even.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n184 MATHEMA TICS\nSince x and y are even, they are divisible by 2 and can be expressed in the form\nx = 2m, for some natural number m and  y = 2n, for some natural number n.\nThen xy = 4 mn. Since 4 mn is divisible by 2, so is xy.\nTherefore, xy is even.\nTheor em A1.3 :  The pr oduct of any thr ee consecutive even natural numbers is\ndivisible by 16.\nProof :  Any three consecutive even numbers will be of the form 2 n, 2n + 2 and\n2n + 4, for some natural number n. We need to prove that their product\n2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nNow , 2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 2 n × 2( n \n+1) × 2( n + 2)\n= 2 × 2 × 2 n(n + 1)( n + 2) = 8 n(n + 1)( n + 2).\nNow  we have two cases. Either n is even or odd.  Let us examine each case.\nSuppose n is even : Then we can write n = 2m, for some natural number m.\nAnd, then 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 8 n(n + 1)( n + 2) = 16 m(2m + 1)(2 m + 2).\nTherefore, 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nNext, suppose n is odd. Then n + 1 is even and we can write n + 1  = 2 r, for some\nnatural number r.\nWe then have : 2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 8n(n + 1)( n + 2)\n=8(2r – 1) × 2 r × (2 r + 1)\n=16r(2r – 1)(2 r + 1)\nTherefore, 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nSo, in both cases we have shown that the product of any three consecutive even\nnumbers is divisible by 16.\nWe conclude this chapter with a few remarks on the dif ference between how\nmathematicians discover results and how formal rigorous proofs are written down. As\nmentioned above, each proof has a key intuitive idea (sometimes more than one).\nIntuition is central to a mathematician’ s way of thinking and discovering results. Very\noften the proof of a theorem comes to a mathematician all jumbled up. A mathematician\nwill often experiment with several routes of thought, and logic, and examples, before\nshe/he can hit upon the correct solution or proof. It is only after the creative phase\nsubsides that all the arguments are gathered together to form a proper proof.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa\nRamanujan used very high levels of intuition to arrive at many of his statements, which\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 185\nhe claimed were true. Many of these have turned\nout be true and are well known theorems. However ,\neven to this day mathematicians all over the world\nare struggling to prove  (or disprove) some of his claims\n(conjectures).\nEXERCISE A1.4\n1.Find counter-examples to disprove the following statements:\n(i)If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then the triangles are\ncongruent.\n(ii)A quadrilateral with all sides equal is a square.\n(iii)A quadrilateral with all angles equal is a square.\n(iv)For integers a and b, a b2 2+  = a + b\n(v)2n2 + 11 is a prime for all whole numbers n.\n(vi) n2 – n + 41 is a prime for all positive integers n.\n2.Take your favourite proof and analyse it step-by-step along the lines discussed in\nSection A1.5 (what is given, what has been proved, what theorems and axioms have\nbeen used, and so on).\n3.Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even.\n4.Prove that the product of two odd numbers is odd.\n5.Prove that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by 6.\n6.Prove that infinitely many points lie on the line whose equation is y = 2x.\n(Hint : Consider the point ( n, 2n) for any integer n.)\n7.You must have had a friend who must have told you to think of a number and do\nvarious things to it, and then without knowing your original number , telling you what\nnumber you ended up with. Here are two examples. Examine why they work.\n(i)Choose a number . Double it. Add nine. Add your original number . Divide by\nthree. Add four . Subtract your original number . Your result is seven.\n(ii)Write down any three-digit number (for example, 425). Make a six-digit number by\nrepeating these digits in the same order (425425). Your new number is divisible by\n7, 11 and 13.\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\n(1887–1920)\nFig. A1.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n186 MATHEMA TICS\nA1.6 Summary\nIn this Appendix, you have studied the following points:\n1.In mathematics, a statement is only acceptable if it is either always true or always false.\n2.To show that a mathematical statement is false, it is enough to find a single counter -\nexample.\n3.Axioms are statements which are assumed to be true without proof.\n4.A conjecture is a statement we believe is true based on our mathematical intuition, but\nwhich we are yet to prove.\n5.A mathematical statement whose truth has been established (or proved) is called a theorem.\n6.The main logical tool in proving mathematical statements is deductive reasoning.\n7.A proof is made up of a successive sequence of mathematical statements. Each statement\nin a proof is logically deduced from a previouly known statement, or from a theorem proved\nearlier , or an axiom, or the hypothesis.\nReprint 2025-26\n",
