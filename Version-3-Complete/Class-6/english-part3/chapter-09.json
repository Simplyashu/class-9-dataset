The intruder wanted to steal Gerrard’s identity. \nIn our day-to-day life we share personal information like telephone \nnumber, house address, mobile number, date of birth, e-mail address, etc., everyday with people whom we may not know very well. \nDon’t you think it is not safe to share information in today’s digital age? \nSomeone like the intruder in the play ‘If I Were You’ might misuse your unique and personal identity details. This is called identity theft.\nThe cases of online identity thefts are increasing day by day. Collect \ninformation about cases of identity theft and share it in the class.\nReading  CompRehension\nRead the following text and answer the questions that  \nfollow. \nText I\ninteRview with a deteCtive\nHis appearance was clean, cool and deliberately ambiguous. Under the sanctuary of his aviators, his eyes silently scanned the room. He is a Manhattan-based, third-generation private detective who’s been in the business for more than three decades — specialising in surveillance and being an overall mystery-tinged badass. We asked him everything we’ve ever wanted to know about the profession.\nUnit 9.indd   124 20-02-2023   09:29:55\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nUnit 9125\nNotesInterviewer  : So, what exactly do you do?\nDetective  : I do a lot of surveillance. Basically, \nsomeone who wonders, “What is this other \nperson up to?” If it’s insurance \ncompany (surveying someone on workers’ compensation), they’ll ask, “Is he back working?” Things like that.\n  Another very common request is locating people, and it could be for \na lot \nof reasons. I had a case recently, a man hadn’t been in touch with his mother for 20 years and I helped him find her.\nInterviewer\n : What kind of skills make for a good PI (Private Investigator)?\nDetective\n : Patience  — Number one. You have to \npay attention. You have to be the kind of person, if you sit in front of a door watching it for six hours, and you haven’t seen your guy.\n  You have to plan accordingly, and be willing to make sacrifices \nin order to stay \nout there. It’s not a job for people who want to slack off.\nInterviewer\n : If you needed to locate someone, what’s \nthe ideal information you need to start?\nDetective  : Usually, this is what I tell people, “If you want \nto find someone, I need the name \nwith the exact spelling, the DOB if you know it, the social security number, and a last known, official address where they’ve lived within the past 15 years.” Because that means they’ll be in our database.\nInterviewer\n : Do most private investigators \nhave a \nrelationship with local police? \nDetective  : I would say that’s kind of a myth. Most cops wouldn’t even do \nit in the first \nplace, because they know how serious a violation it is.\nInterviewer\n : Do most private eyes carry guns?\nDetective  : I don’t think so. We don’t kill people but help them.surveillance:  close \nobservation, especially of a \nsuspected spy or criminal\nDOB: Date of Birth\nUnit 9.indd   125 20-02-2023   09:29:55\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n Words and ExprEssions  1126Interviewer  : What do films and television shows get \nwrong about being a PI?\nDetective  : The big difference is, the things you see \nin \nfilms do happen to private detectives, \nbut they’re shrinking down maybe 20 \nyears of adventure into an episode. After 30 years, I probably have one good movie worth of experiences.\n(Adapted from https://www.thrillist.com/.../private-detective-interview-\nquestions-you-ve-always-want) \n1.

This is another aspect of changing the identity. Let us listen to story of King Shibi.\nThere was a great king, Shibi Rana who had immense \npower then, even gods in heavens were amazed. They feared that Shibi might take away their kingdoms. They devised a plan to test his sense of justice. So they decided to reach Shibi’s kingdom in disguise.\nOne day, Shibi Rana was sitting on his throne. His \ncourtroom was surrounded by majestic gardens. There came a scared dove flying to him and it was followed by a fierce looking eagle. The king gave shelter to the dove and saved her. The eagle argued that the king has taken away his food\n — the dove. It would starve. The king \nassured the eagle that he would give equal quantity of any other food. The eagle asked for King Shibi’s flesh. The magnanimous king agreed with a smile. A balance was\n \nbrought in the court. It was soon found that with each addition of the king’s flesh the dove grew heavier. The equal balance was not arrived at. But the king remained calm and unperturbed.\nThe Gods in the guise of dove and eagle were assured of \nShibi’s righteousness. The forms of the eagle and the dove soon disappeared. In their place stood Indra, the king of the Gods and Agni, the God of fire smiling and blessing the king for his benevolence and greatness.\n1.\n  Why were the Gods in heaven afraid of King Shibi?\n_____________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________\n2.
