There I was put into a primary school, and I can well recollect those days, including the names and other particulars of the teachers who taught me. As at Porbandar, so here, there is hardly anything to note about my studies. I could only have been a mediocre student. From this school I went to the suburban school and thence to high school, having already reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever told a lie, during this short period, either to my teachers or to my school-mates. However, I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My books and my lessons were my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and \nto run back home as soon as the school closed  — that was \nmy daily habit. There is an incident which occurred at the examination during my first year at high school and which is worth recording. Mr Giles, the educational Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to write as a spelling exercise. One of the words was ‘Kettle’. I had misspelt it. The teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my neighbour’s slate, for I had thought that the teacher was there to supervise us against copying. The result was that all the boys, except myself, were found to have spelt every word correctly. I could never learn the art of ‘copying’. Yet the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my teacher. I was by nature, blind to the faults of elders. Later I came to know of many other failings of this teacher, but my regard for him remained the same. Two other incidents belonging to the same period have always clung to my memory. As a rule I had distaste for any reading beyond my school books. The daily lessons had to be done, because I disliked being taken to task by my teacher as much as I disliked deceiving him. Therefore I would do the lessons, \nprompt:  cause someone to \ntake a course of action\ndeceive:  give a mistaken \nimpression\nUnit 6.indd   81 30-05-2018   11:55:47\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n Words and ExprEssions  182\nNotesbut often without my mind in them. Thus, when even the \nlessons could not be done properly, there was of course no question of any extra reading. But somehow my eyes fell on a book purchased by my father. It was Shravana Pitribhakti \nNataka. I read it with intense interest. One of the pictures I was shown was of Shravana carrying, by means of slings fitted for his shoulders, his blind parents on a pilgrimage. The book and the picture left an indelible impression on my mind. \n(An excerpt from The Story of My Experiments with Truth , Mohandas \nKaramchand Gandhi)\n1.

She is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pepsico. She is one among the world’s most powerful women. She delivered the following speech at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on 14 December 2013. She was named one of the 25 Greatest Living Legends by NDTV, and was awarded by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan.\nRead the speech delivered by Indra Nooyi and answer the \nquestions that follow.\nMr President and NDTV, thank you very much for this \nincredible honour.\nMalcom Gladwell in his book, Outliers says: “Who you \nare cannot be separated from where you came from.”\nI left India 35 years ago, went to the USA and had \ntremendous success in the meritocracy. But none of that \ncould have happened if I would not have had wonderful upbringing very much here in India. So I have a lot to thank India for. Now my three lessons I would like to share  \nwith you.\nFirst, please be a lifelong student. You know when we \nwere kids, we used to ask questions like “Why is the sky blue?”, “Why the birds flying so high?” But for some reasons, as we get older, that curiosity goes away. And if we are happy with the knowledge we have, then we are actually going to atrophy. So, please remain a lifelong student, don’t lose that curiosity.\nSecond, whatever you do, throw yourself into it, throw \nyour head, heart and hands into it. I look at my job not as a meritocracy:  a ruling or \ninfluential class of educated \nor able people\natrophy:  gradual decline in \neffectiveness or vigour due \nto underuse or neglect\nUnit 6.indd   84 30-05-2018   11:55:47\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nUnit 684 85job, I look at it as a Calling, as a Passion and I don’t care about \nthe hours, about the hardships, because to me everything is \na joy. So whatever you do, please look upon it as a Calling, a Passion, not as a job, not as something temporary.\nThe third and the most important one, please help \nothers rise. Greatness comes not from a position, but from helping build a future. All of us in position of power have an obligation to pull others up. You know, as I stand here today, I look at my responsibility not as accepting an honour, I look upon it as accepting a challenge and a responsibility, an obligation to actually make it possible for people who are younger to come up and achieve levels of greatness, so they too can be on the stage sometime in the future.\n (Source: Speech delivered by Indra Nooyi at the Rashtrapati \nBhawan on 14 December 2013)\n1.
