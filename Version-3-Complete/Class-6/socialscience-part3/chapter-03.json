After discussing this multi-\ndimensional problem through examples,\nthe chapter discusses the way poverty is\nanalysed by social scientists. Poverty\ntrends in India and the world are\nillustrated through the concept of the\npoverty line. Causes of poverty as well as\nanti-poverty measures taken by the\ngovernment are also discussed. The\nchapter ends with br oadening the of ficial\nconcept of poverty into human poverty.\nIntroductionIntroductionIntroductionIntroductionIntroduction\nIn our daily life, we come across many\npeople who we think are poor. They could\nbe landless labourers in villages  or\npeople living in overcrowded jhuggisjhuggisjhuggis\njhuggisjhuggis  in\ncities. NITI Aayog uses MultidimensionalPoverty as a Challenge Chapter\nPoverty Index to analyse the problem of\npoverty faced by the country. The ratio\nof multidimensional poverty has fallen from\napproximately 55 per cent in 200 5–06,\n25 per cent in 201\n5–16 and to 15 per cent\nin 201 9–21. It is also expected that\nmultidimensional poverty will soon\nreach single digit.\nTwo Typical Cases of Poverty\nUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban CaseUrban Case\nThirty-three year old Ram Saran works\nas a daily-wage labourer in a wheat flour\nmill near Ranchi in Jharkhand. He\nmanages to earn around `3,500 a\nmonth when he finds employment,\nwhich is not often. The money is not\nenough to sustain his family of six— hisPoverty as a Challenge33\nPicture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1Picture 3.1   Story  of Ram Saran\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n30  \n  Economics\nwife and four children aged between 12\nyears to six months.  He has to send\nmoney home to his old parents who live\nin a village near Ramgar h. His father ,\na landless labour er, and his br other\nwho lives in Hazaribagh depend on Ram\nSaran for sustenance. Ram Saran lives\nin a one-room rented house in a\ncrowded basti in the outskirts of the\ncity. It  is a temporary shack built of\nbricks and clay tiles. His wife Santa\nDevi, works as a part time maid in a\nfew houses and manages to earn\nanother `1500. They manage a meagre\nmeal of dal and rice twice a day, but\nthere is never enough for all of them.\nHis elder son works as a helper in a\ntea shop to supplement the family ’s\nincome and earns another `700 while\nhis 10-year  old daughter  goes to school\nand takes care of the younger siblings.\nThey have only two pairs of hand-me-\ndown clothes each. New ones are\nbought only when the old clothes\nbecome unwearable. Shoes are a luxury.\nThe younger one relishes the dal-rice\nserved at school .Rural case\nLakha Singh belongs to a small village\nnear Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His\nfamily does not own any land. So, they\ndo odd jobs for the big far mers. W ork\nis erratic and so is income. At times\nthey get paid `200 for a hard day’s\nwork. But often it is in kind like a few\nkilograms of wheat or dal or even\nvegetables for toiling in the farm\nthroughout the day. The family of six\nare barely able to  manage two square\nmeals a day. Lakha lives in a kuchha\nhut on the outskirts of the village. The\nwomen of the family spend the day\nchopping fodder and collecting\nfirewood in the fields. His father , a\ntuberculosis patient, passed away two\nyears ago due to lack of medication.\nHis mother now suffers from the same\ndisease and life is slowly ebbing away.\nAlthough, the village has a primary\nschool, Lakha never went ther e but\nhe is happy to find his children going\nto school. New clothes happen once\nin a few years. Even soap and oil\nare a luxury for the family.\nStudy the above cases of poverty\nand discuss the following issues\nrelated to poverty:\n•Landlessness\n•Unemployment\n•Size of families\n•Literacy levels\n•Health/nutrition\n•Helplessness\nPicture 3.2   Story  of Lakha Singh\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPoverty as a Challenge  \n   31\nThese two typical cases illustrate many\ndimensions of poverty. They show that\npoverty means hunger and lack of shelter .\nThis also speaks about a situation in which\nparents are not able to give their children\nnutritious food three times a day or a\nsituation where sick people cannot afford\ntreatment. Poverty also means lack of\nclean water and sanitation facilities. It also\nmeans lack of a regular job with decent\nminimum wages. Above all, it means living\nwith a sense of helplessness. Poor people\nare in a situation in which they are ill-\ntreated at almost every place, in farms,\nfactories, government offices, hospitals,\nrailway stations, etc. Obviously, nobody\nwould like to live in poverty.\nOne of the biggest challenges of\nindependent India has been to bring\nmillions of its people out of abject poverty.\nMahatama Gandhi said that India would\nbe truly independent only when the poorest\nof its people become free of human\nsuffering.\nPoverty as seen by social scientists\nSince poverty has many facets, social\nscientists look at it through a variety of\nindicators. Usually the indicators are used\nto relate with the levels of income and\nconsumption. In recent times, a variety of\nother indicators have also been used to\nrecognise whether  a person is poor  \nor not.\nFor example, National  Multidimensional\nPoverty Index is calculated on the basis of\nthree broad indicators: health indicators\nlike nutrition, child and adolescent\nmortality, maternal health. Education\nindicators like years of schooling and school\nattendance, and standard of living indicator\nlike cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water ,\nhousing, electricity, assets, bank account.\nIndicators such as social exclusion and\nvulnerability are also used to understand\npoverty (see box).Social Exclusion\nAccording to this concept, poverty\nmust be seen in terms of the poor\nhaving to live only in a poor\nsurrounding with other poor people,\nexcluded from enjoying social\nequality of better -off people in better\nsurroundings. Social exclusion can\nbe both a cause as well as a\nconsequence of poverty in the usual\nsense. Br oadly, it is a process thr ough\nwhich individuals or groups are\nexcluded from facilities, benefits and\nopportunities that others (the\n“better-offs”) enjoy. A typical\nexample is the working of the caste\nsystem in India in which people\nbelonging to certain castes are\nexcluded from equal opportunities.\nSocial exclusion thus may lead to\nor can cause more damage than\nhaving a very low income.\nVulnerability\nVulnerability  to poverty is a\nmeasure, which describes the\ngreater probability of certain\ncommunities (say, members of a\nbackward caste) or individuals (such\nas a widow or a physically\nhandicapped person) of becoming or\nremaining poor. Vulnerability is\ndetermined by the options available\nto different communities for finding\nan alternative living in terms of\nassets, education, health and job\nopportunities. Further, it is analysed\non the basis of the greater risks these\ngroups face at the time of natural\ndisasters (earthquakes, tsunami).\nAdditional analysis is made of their\nsocial and economic ability to handle\nthese risks. In fact, vulnerability\ndescribes the greater probability of\nbeing more adversely affected than\nother people when bad time comes\nfor everybody, whether a flood or an\nearthquake or simply a fall in the\navailability of jobs!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n32  \n   Economics\nPoverty Line\nAt the centre of the discussion on poverty\nis the concept of the ‘poverty line’. A\ncommon method used to measure poverty\nis based on the income o r consumption\nlevels. The term ‘consumption’ means the\namount spent on various items such as\nfood, clothing, etc., by a family. A person\nis considered poor if his or her income or\nconsumption level falls below a given\n‘minimum level’ necessary to fulfill the\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\nbasic needs is different at different times\nand in different countries. Therefore,\npoverty line may vary with time and place.\nEach country uses an imaginary line that\nis considered appropriate for its existing\nlevel of development and its accepted\nminimum social norms. For example, a\nperson not having a car in the United\nStates may be consider ed poor . In India,\nowning a car is still considered a luxury.\nWhile determining the poverty line in\nIndia, till a few years ago, a minimum\nlevel of food requirement, clothing,\nfootwear, fuel and electricity, educational\nand medical needs, etc., were taken into\nconsideration . The physical quantities  of\nthese needs were multiplied by their\nprices in rupees. The formula for food\nrequirement while estimating the\npoverty line was based on the desired\ncalorie requirement. Food items, such\nas cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil,\nsugar, etc., together provided these\nneeded calories . The calorie needs vary\ndepending on age, sex and the type of\nwork that a person does. The accepted\naverage calorie requirement in India was\n2400 calories per person per day in rural\nareas and 2100 calories per person per\nday in urban areas. Since people living\nin rural areas engage themselves in more\nphysical work, calorie requirements in\nrural areas were considered to be higher\nthan in urban areas. The bare monetary\nexpenditure per capita needed forbuying these calorie requirements in terms\nof food grains, etc., and reported by\nfamilies has been considered as poverty\nline. This amount was revised periodically,\ntaking into consideration the rise in prices.\nBased on the global developments, the\nGovernment of India has begun to\nestimate the proportion of poor in India\nusing 12 developmental indicators, which\nis popularly known as Multidimensional\nPoverty Index (see box). This national\nindex complements the income or\nconsumption expenditure based poverty\nmeasurement because it measures and\ncompares deprivations directly.\n  Let’s Discuss\nDiscuss the following:\n•What could be the difference between\nconsumption based expenditure\nPoverty Line and National\nMultidimensional Poverty Index?\n•What do you think would be the\n“minimum necessary level” in your\nlocality ?\nPoverty  Estimates\nBased on the methodology described in\nthe previous section, the number and\nproportion of poor people in India, called\nHead Count Ratio (HCR),  is estimated.\nTable 3.1 shows that during the 1990s,\nthe proportion of ‘consumption\nexpenditure based’ poor declined from\n45 to 37 per cent. However, the number\nof poor remained at about 40 crores.\nDuring 2000–2011, both the proportion\nand the number of poor declined. The\nproportion of multidimensional poor\nduring 2015–2021 declined from 25 to\n15 percent. As per the official record,\n13.5 crore people have escaped\nmultidimensional poverty during this\nperiod. Specifically deprivation  against\nvarious indicators have declined more\nsharply in rural areas than in urban\nareas.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n  Poverty as a Challenge\n   33\nSource:   India in figur es, 2018, Gover nment of India Central Statistics of fice,\n   niti.gov.in /state-statistics (accessed on Nov. 15, 2021); National Multidimensional\nPoverty Index: A Pr ogress Review 2023, NITI Aayog, Gover nment of India.\nTwelve Indicators of National Multidimensional Poverty Index\nNITI Aayog, a Gover nment of India or ganisation evolved the National Multidimensional\nPoverty Index ( NMPI) using the following 12 indicators. If an individual is found\ndeprived on  these indicators, he or she is considered as multidimensional poor.\n1.Nutrition:  A household is considered deprived if any child between the ages\nof 0 to 59 months, or woman between the ages of 15 to 49 years, or man\nbetween the ages of 15 to 54 years is found to be undernourished.\n2.Child-Adolescent Mortality: A household is deprived if any child or adolescent\nunder 18 years of age has died in the household in the five-year period\npreceding the survey.\n3.Maternal Health: A household is deprived if any woman in the household\nwho has given birth in the 5 years preceding the survey has not received\nassistance from trained skilled medical personnel during the recent childbirth.\n4.Years of Schooling: A household is deprived if not even one member of the\nhousehold aged 10 years or older has completed six years of schooling.\n5.School attendance:  A household is deprived if any school-aged child is not\nattending school up to the age at which he/she would complete class.\n6.Cooking Fuel:  A household is deprived if a household cooks with dung,\nagricultural crops, shrubs, wood, charcoal, or coal.\n7.Sanitation:  A household is deprived if the household has unimproved or no\nsanitation facility or it is improved but shared with other households.\n8.Drinking Water:  A household is deprived if the household does not have access\nto improved drinking water or safe drinking water is at least a 30-minute\nwalk  from home (as a round trip).\n9.Housing:  A household is deprived if the household has inadequate housing: the floor\nis made of natural materials, or the roof or wall are made of rudimentary materials.\n10.Electricity:  A household is deprived if the household has no electricity.\n11.Assets:  A household is deprived if the household does not own more than one\nof these assets: radio, TV, telephone, computer, animal cart, bicycle, motorbike,\nor refrigerator; and does not own a car or truck.\n12.Bank Account: A household is deprived if no household member has a bank\naccount or a post of fice account.\nSource:   https://www.undp.org/india/national-multidimensional-poverty-index-progress-review-2023Table 3. 1: Estimates of Poverty in India 1993 – 2019\nYear Head Cou nt Ratio (%) Number of poor (in millions)\nRural Urban Total Rural Urban Combined\nConsumption-based\n1993–94 50 32 45 329 75 404\n2004–05 42 26 37 326 81 407\n2009–10 34 21 30 278 76 355\n2011–12 26 14 22 217 53 270\nMultidimensional (Indicator) based\n2015-16 32.6 8.7 25 NA NA NA\n2019-21 19.3 5.3 15 NA NA NA\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n34  \n   Economics\n  Let’ s Discuss\nStudy Table 3.1 and answer the following\nquestions:\n•Even if poverty ratio declined between\n1993–94 and 2004–05, why did the\nnumber of poor remain at about 407\nmillion?\n•Are the dynamics of poverty reduction\nthe same in rural and urban India?  Let’s Discuss\nStudy the Graph 3.1 and do the following:\n•Identify the three states where the HCR\nis the highest.\n•Identify the three states where HCR\nis the lowest.\n•List the states which have HCR lower\nor higher than HCR for all India.\nInter-State Disparities\nPoverty in India also has another aspect\nor dimension. The proportion of poor people\nis not the same in every state (see graph\n3.1). Although state le vel poverty has\nwitnessed a significant  decline from the\nlevels of early seventies, the success rate of\nreducing poverty varies from state to state.\nIt is pertinent to note that the states of\nKarnataka, Tamil  Nadu, Delhi, Punjab,\nHimachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh,\nHaryana and Maharashtra had an  HCR\nwhich was less than 10  per cent  in 2019 –\n21.In the meantime, r emarkable strides\nhave been made by States like Bihar , Uttar\nPradesh , Madhya Pradesh  and Rajasthan.\nStudies also show states following different\nsteps to reduce poverty. For example,\nKerala has focused more on humanresour ce development. In W est Bengal,\nland reform measures have helped in\nreducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and\nTamil Nadu public distribution of food\ngrains have been responsible for the\nimprovement.\nVulnerable Groups\nThe proportion of people below poverty\nline is also not same for all social groups\nand economic categories in India. Social\ngroups, which are most vulnerable to\npoverty are Scheduled Caste and\nScheduled T ribe households. Similarly,\namong the economic groups, the most\nvulnerable groups are the rural\nagricultural-labour households and the\nurban casual-labour households.

Although the average\nof people below poverty line for all groups\nin India is 22; however , 43 out of 100 (see\ngraph 3.2) people belonging to S cheduled\nTribes ar e not able  to meet their basic\nneeds. Similarly, 34 per cent of casual\nworkers in urban areas are below poverty\nline. About 34 per cent of casual farm\nlabour (in rural areas) and 29 per cent\nof Scheduled Castes ar e also poor . The\ndouble disadvantage of being a landless\ncasual wage labour household in the\nsocially disadvantaged social groups of\nthe scheduled caste or the  scheduled\ntribe population highlights the\nseriousness of the problem. Some recent\nstudies have shown that except for the\nscheduled tribe households, all the other\nthree groups (i.e., Scheduled Castes,\nrural agricultural labourers and the\nurban casual labour households) have\nseen a decline in poverty in the 1990s.\nApart from these social groups, there\nis also inequality of incomes within a\nfamily. In poor families all suffer, but\nsome suffer more than others. In some\ncases, women, elderly people and female\ninfants are denied equal access to\nresources available to the family.\nGraph 3.2:  Poverty in India 2011–12: Most V ulnerable Gr oups\nSource:   www.worldbank.or g/2016/India-s-Poverty-Pr ofile (accessed on 29.09.2021)Global Poverty Scenario\nIs India the only country having poor\npeople? For making comparisons between\ndeveloping countries, many international\norganisations like the W orld Bank use a\nuniform standard for the poverty line:\nminimum availability of the equivalent of\n$2.15 per person per day.  The proportion\nof people in different countries living in\nextreme economic poverty—  defined by the\nWorld Bank as living on less than $2.15\nper day—  has fallen from 16.27 per cent\nin 2010 to 9.05 per cent in 2019. Why $\n(dollar) has been used there? In India, we\nuse rupee as a national currency, each\ncountry has its own currency. American\ndollar is used by international agencies to\ncompare data across countries.\nAlthough ther e has been a substantial\nreduction in global poverty, it is marked\nwith gr eat r egional dif ferences. Poverty\ndeclined substantially in China and\nSoutheast Asian countries as a r esult\nof rapid economic growth and massive\ninvestments in human resource\ndevelopment (Read table 3.2 and graph\n3.3 and 3.4). The proportion  of poor in\nChina has become  0.1 per cent in 2020.\nThe W orld Bank r eports r\neveal that i n the\ncountries of South Asia (India, Pakistan,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n36  \n   Economics\nSri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nAfghanistan and Maldives) the decline\nhas also been rapid from 13 per cent in\n2017 to 1 1 per cent in 2021.

They are given in\nthe form of infographics on the next\npage. Each goal was split into various\ntargets to be achieved by the countries\nwho are members of UN.

One historical\nreason is the low level of economic\ndevelopment under the British colonial\nadministration. The policies of the colonial\ngovernment ruined traditional handicrafts\nand discouraged development of industries\nlike textiles. The low rate of growth persisted\nuntil the 1980s . This resulted in less job\nopportunities and low growth rate of\nincomes. This was accompanied by a high\ngrowth of population.\nWith the spread of irrigation and the\nGreen Revolution, many job opportunities were\ncreated in the agricultur e sector . But the impact\nwas limited to some parts of India. The\nindustries, both in the public and the private\nsector , did pr ovide some jobs. But these wer e\nnot enough to absorb all the job seekers.\nUnable to find jobs with better income in cities,\nmany people started working as rickshaw\npullers, vendors, construction workers,\ndomestic servants , etc. With irregular small\nincomes, these people could not afford\nreasonable shelter . They started living in slums\non the outskirts of the cities and the problemsTake the help of your teacher and\ngather the details of each SDG. Do a\nproject report on how your country/\nstate is achieving these goals.of poverty, largely a rural phenomenon also\nbecame a feature of  urban India.\nAnother feature of high poverty rates\nhas been the huge income inequalities.\nOne of the major reasons for this is the\nunequal distribution of land and other\nresources. Despite many policies, we have\nnot been able to tackle the issue of\npoverty. Major policy initiatives like land\nreforms which aimed at redistribution of\nassets in rural areas have not been\nimplemented effectively by most of the\nstate governments. Effective\nimplementation of policy could have\nimproved the life of millions of rural poor.\n Many other socio-cultural and\neconomic factors are also responsible for\npoverty. In order to fulfil social\nobligations and observe religious\nceremonies, people in India, including\nthe very poor, spend a lot of money and\nwaste their hard earned income. Small\nfarmers need money to buy agricultural\ninputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,\netc. Since poor people hardly have any\nsavings, they borrow or accept loan at\nhigher risk. Unable to repay because of\npoverty, they become victims of\nindebtedness. So the high level of\nindebtedness is both the cause and effect\nof poverty.\nSource : https://sdgs.un.org/goals\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n  Poverty as a Challenge\n   39\nAnti-Poverty Measures\nRemoval of poverty has been one of the\nmajor objectives of Indian developmental\nstrategy. The current anti-poverty\nstrategy of the government is based\nbroadly on two factors — (i) promotion\nof economic growth (ii) targeted anti-\npoverty programmes.\nOver a period of thirty years of\nindependent India, lasting up to the early\neighties, there were little per capita\nincome growth and not much reduction\nin poverty. Official poverty estimates\nwhich were about 45 per cent in the early\n1950s remained the same even in the\nearly eighties. Since the eighties, India’s\neconomic growth has been one of the\nfastest in the world. The growth rate\njumped from the average of about 3.5\nper cent a year in the 1970s to about 6\nper cent during the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe two decades of 21st century\n(2000–2020) has also witnessed the rapid\neconomic development. The higher\ngrowth rates have significantly helped in\nthe reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is\nbecoming clear that there is a strong link\nbetween economic growth and poverty\nreduction. Economic growth widens\nopportunities and provides the resources\nneeded to invest in human development.\nThis also encourages people to send\ntheir children, including the girl child, to\nschools in the hope of getting bettereconomic returns by investing in\neducation. The poor may not be able to\ntake advantage from the opportunities\ncreated by economic gr owth. However ,\ngrowth in the agriculture sector is much\nbelow expectations. This has a direct\nbearing on poverty. A large number of poor\npeople live in villages and are dependent\non agriculture.\nIn these circumstances, there is a clear\nneed for targeted anti-poverty\nprogrammes. Although there are many\nschemes which are formulated to affect\npoverty directly or indirectly. Some of them\nare worth mentioning.\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee  Act, 2005  aims\nto provide 100 days of wage employment\nto every household to ensure livelihood\nsecurity in rural areas. It also aimed at\nsustainable development to address the\ncause of dr ought, deforestration and soil\nerosion. One-third of the proposed jobs\nhave been reserved for women under this\nact. The wage rate for unskilled manual\nworkers is revised regularly,\nPradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti\nAbhiyan (PM Poshan)  is a flagship\nprogramme of Government of India. It\nwas initiated with twin purpose — (i) to\nimprove the nutritional requirement\nespecially calorie and the protein intake\nof the child, (ii) improve the school\nenrolment and eliminate the drop out\nfrom the school. It targets students from\nClasses I to VIII in Government,\nGovernment aided schools and special\ntraining centres under the Right to\nEducation Act.\nThis scheme is implemented with the\nsupport of local governments and various\ncommunity organisations. This programme\nencourages poor children, belonging to\ndisadvantaged sections, to attend school\nmore regularly and helps them concentrate\non classroom activities.  Let’ s Discuss\nObserve some of the poor families\naround you and try to find the following:\n•Which social and economic group do\nthey belong to?\n•Who are the earning members in the\nfamily?\n•What is the condition of the old people\nin the family?\n•Are all the children (both boys and girls)\nattending schools?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n40  \n   Economics\nThe Challenges Ahead\nPoverty has certainly declined in India. But\ndespite the progress, poverty reduction\nremains India’s most compelling challenge.\nWide disparities in poverty are visible\nbetween rural and urban areas and\namong different States also. Certain social\nand economic groups are more vulnerable\nto poverty. Poverty reduction is expected\nto make better India. This would be\npossible mainly due to higher economic\ngrowth, increasing focus on universal\neducation, declining population growth;\nempowerment of the women and the\neconomically weaker sections of society\nwould also facilitate the same.\nThe income based definition of poverty\ncaptures only a limited part of what\npoverty really means to people. It is about\na ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living\nrather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living.\nMany scholars advocate that we must\nbroaden the concept into human poverty . A\nlarge number of people may have been able\nto feed themselves. But do they have\neducation? Or shelter? Or health care?\nOr job security? Or self-confidence? Are\nthey free from caste and gender\ndiscrimination? Is the practice of child\nlabour still common? Worldwide\nexperience shows that with development,\nthe definition of what constitutes poverty\nalso changes. In this chapter we have\nlooked at the different approaches to\nmeasure poverty. The National\nMultidimensional Poverty Index put\nforward by NITI Aayog reveals that the\nnumber and proportion of\nmultidimensionally poor has declined in\nIndia. This may be due to the array of\nGovernment interventions initiated in\nrecent years. What do you think?Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva\nAbhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim\nto reduce maternal and infant mortality by\nproviding quality antenatal care to the\npregnant women throughout the country.\nThe scheme works towards  safe\npregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps\nin the service of the maternal care, to ensure\nconstant and regular treatment to the\nbeneficiaries. Services are provided on the\nninth day of every month. This programme\nfollows a systematic approach for\nengagement with private practitioners,\nmotivating them to volunteer in the scheme\nat government health facilities.\nPradhan Mantri Ujjwala Y ojana (PMUY)\naims towards women empowerment in\nrural areas. It encourages the use of\nsmoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them\nfrom chronic respiratory disorders and\npoor eye sights. It was launched in 2016\nwith an aim to provide clean cooking fuel\n(liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to\neconomically poor households especially\nin the rural areas, who cook using\ntraditional methods by using either coal,\nwood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries\nare Below Poverty Line (BPL) households,\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled T ribes,\nforest dwellers and marginalised group\nhouseholds. To encourage the use of LPG,\nthe scheme provides a completely free\nconnection, including the first refill  and\na stove.\nOver the years there is an increase in\nthe LPG coverage throughout the country.\nConnections are issued in the name of the\nfemale member of the family. This scheme\nalso promotes environment sustainability\nby reducing deforestation and carbon\nemission generated from burning coal and\nfirewood. The use of clean cooking fuel,\ni.e., LPG means less time and effort in\ncollecting firewood and encourages women\nto participate in social and economic\nactivities.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n  Poverty as a Challenge\n   41\n  Summary\nIn this chapter , we have looked at the dif ferent appr oaches of measuring poverty. The National\nMultidimensional Poverty Index, put forward by NITI Aayog in collaboration with UNDP and Oxford\nPolicy and Human Development Initiative reveals that on the Headcount Ratio of multidimensionally\npoor, ther e has been a considerable r eduction. Even when some of the states like Kerala and T amil\nNadu have reached less than 10 per cent on the HCR front, much is yet to be achieved by the other\nstates. However , it is also to be noted that due to the array of Gover nment intervention policies\nbetween 2005–06 and 2019–21 there has been significant decline in the number of MPI poor in the\nstates of Bihar , Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n  Exercises\n1.How is the poverty line estimated in India?\n2.Do you think that the present methodology of poverty estimation is appropriate?\n3.Describe poverty trends in India since 1993.\n4.Discuss the major reasons for poverty in India.\n5.Identify the social and economic groups which are most vulnerable to poverty in India.\n6.Give an account of interstate disparities of poverty in India.\n7.Describe global poverty trends.\n8.Describe the role of government in reducing poverty in India?\n  9.
