The poor\nhouseholds are more vulnerable to food\ninsecurity whenever there is a problem\nof production or distribution of food\ncrops. Food security depends on the\nPublic Distribution System (PDS) and\ngovernment vigilance and action at\ntimes, when this security is threatened.\nWhat is food security?\nFood is as essential for living as air is for\nbreathing. But food security means\nsomething more than getting two square\nmeals. Food security has following\ndimensions\n(a)availability of food  means food\nproduction within the country, food\nimports and the previous years stock\nstored in government granaries.\n(b)accessibility  means food is within reach\nof every person.\n(c)affordability implies that an individual\nhas enough money to buy sufficient,\nsafe and nutritious food to meet one's\ndietary needs.\nThus, food security is ensured in a\ncountry only if (1) enough food is available\nfor all the persons (2) all persons have\nthe capacity to buy food of acceptable\nquality and (3) there is no barrier on\naccess to food.\nWhy food security?\nThe poorest section of the society might\nbe food insecure most of the times while\npersons above the poverty line might also\nbe food insecure when the country facesFood Security in India Chapter4\nFood Security in India\na national disaster/calamity like\nearthquake, drought, flood, tsunami,\nwidespread failure of crops causing\nfamine, etc. How is food security\naffected during a  calamity?  Due to a\nnatural calamity, say drought, total\nproduction of foodgrains decreases. It\ncreates a shortage of food in the affected\nareas. Due to shortage of food, the prices\ngoes up. At the high prices, some people\ncannot afford to buy food. If such calamity\nhappens in a very wide spread area or is\nstretched over a longer time period, it\nmay cause a situation of starvation.\nA massive starvation might take a turn\nof famine.\nA Famine is characterised by wide\nspread deaths due to starvation an dIn the 1970s, food security was\nunderstood as the “availability at all times\nof adequate supply of basic foodstuffs”\n(UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new\ndimension to food security and\nemphasised the “access” to food through\nwhat he called ‘entitlements’ — a\ncombination of what one can produce,\nexchange in the market alongwith state\nor other socially provided supplies.\nAccordingly, there has been a substantial\nshift in the understanding of food security.\nThe 1995 W orld F ood Summit declared,\n“Food security at the individual,\nhousehold, regional, national and global\nlevels exists when all people, at all times,\nhave physical and economic access to\nsufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet\ntheir dietary needs and food preferences\nfor an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996,\np.3). The declaration further recognises\nthat “poverty eradication is essential to\nimprove access to food”.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nFood Security in India  \n   43\nPicture 4.2 During the Bengal Famine of\n1943, a family leaves its village\nin Chittagong district in Bengal.Picture 4.1  Starvation victims arriving at a\nrelief centre, 1945.

It is, however ,\ndisturbing to note that even today, famine\nlike conditions exist in many parts of the\ncountry, leading to starvation deaths at\ntimes. Natural calamities and pandemics\nmay also lead to food shortage. For\nexample Covid-19 pandemic had an\nadverse impact upon the food security.\nRestriction on movement of people and\ngoods and services impacted economic\nactivity. Therefore food security is needed\nin a country to ensure food at all times,\nincluding calamities and pandemics\nWho are food-insecure?\nAlthough a large section of people suffer\nfrom food and nutrition insecurity in\nIndia, the worst affected groups are\nlandless people with little or no land to\ndepend upon, traditional artisans,\nproviders of traditional services, petty self-\nemployed workers and destitutes\nincluding beggars.

His\neldest son Somu who is 10 years old\nalso works as a pali to look after the\ncattle of the Sarpanch of the village\nSatpal Singh. Somu is employed for\nthe whole year by the Sarpanch and\nis paid a sum of Rs 1,000 for this\nwork. Ramu has three more sons\nand two daughters but they are too\nyoung to work on the field. His wife\nSunhari is also (part time) working\nas house cleaner for the livestock,\nremoving and managing cow dung.\nShe gets ½ litre milk and some\ncooked food along with vegetables\nfor her daily work. Besides she also\nworks in the field along with her\nhusband in the busy season and\nsupplements his earnings.\nAgriculture being a seasonal\nactivity employs Ramu only during\ntimes of sowing, transplanting and\nharvesting. He remains unemployed\nfor about 4 months during the\nperiod of plant consolidation and\nmaturing in a year . He looks for\nwork in other activities. Some times\nhe gets employment in brick laying\nor in construction activities in the\nvillage. By all his efforts, Ramu is\nable to earn enough either in cash\nor kind for him to buy essentials for\ntwo square meals for his family.\nHowever , during the days when he\nis unable to get some work, he and\nhis family really face difficulties and\nsometimes his small kids have to\nsleep without food. Milk and\nvegetables are not a regular part of\nmeals in the family. Ramu is food\ninsecure during 4 months when he\nremains unemployed because of the\nseasonal nature of agriculture work.engaged in seasonal activities and are paid\nvery low wages that just ensure bare\nsurvival .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nFood Security in India  \n   45\nLet’s Discuss\n•Does Ahmad have a regular income\nfrom rickshaw-pulling?\n•How does the yellow card help AhmadStory of Ahmad\nAhmad is a rickshaw puller in\nBangalore. He has shifted from\nJhumri Taliah along with his 3\nbrothers, 2 sisters and old parents.\nHe stays in a jhuggi . The survival of\nall members of his family depends on\nhis daily earnings from pulling\nrickshaw . However , he does not have\na secured employment and his\nearnings fluctuate every day. During\nsome days he gets enough earning for\nhim to save some amount after buying\nall his day-to-day necessities. On\nother days, he barely earns enough\nto buy his daily necessities. H owever ,\nfortunately, Ahmad has a yellow card,\nwhich is PDS Card for below poverty\nline people. With this card, Ahmad\ngets sufficient quantity of wheat, rice,\nsugar and kerosene oil for his daily\nuse. He gets these essentials at half\nof the market price. He purchases his\nmonthly stock during a particular day\nwhen the ration shop is opened for\nbelow poverty people. In this way,\nAhmad is able to eke out his survival\nwith less than sufficient earnings for\nhis big family where he is the only\nearning member .Let’s Discuss\n•Why is agriculture a seasonal activity?\n•Why is Ramu unemployed for about\nfour months in a year?\n•What does Ramu do when he is\nunemployed?\n•Who are supplementing income in\nRamu’s family?\n•Why does Ramu face difficulty when\nhe is unable to have work?\n•When is Ramu food insecure?run his family even with small\nearnings from rickshaw-pulling?\nThe social composition along with the\ninability to buy food also plays a role in\nfood insecurity. The SCs, STs and some\nsections of the OBCs (lower castes among\nthem) who have either poor land-base or\nvery low land productivity are prone to\nfood insecurity. The people affected by\nnatural disasters, who have to migrate to\nother areas in search of work, are also\namong the most food insecure people. A\nhigh incidence of malnutrition prevails\namong women. This is a matter of serious\nconcern as it puts even the unborn baby\nat the risk of malnutrition. A large\nproportion of pregnant and nursing\nmothers and children under the age of 5\nyears constitute an important segment of\nthe food insecure population.\nAccording to the National Health and\nFamily Survey (NHFS) 1998–99, the\nnumber of such women and children is\napproximately 11 crore .\nThe food insecure people are\ndisproportionately large in some regions\nof the country, such as economically\nbackward states with high incidence of\npoverty, tribal and remote areas, regions\nmore prone to natural disasters etc. In\nfact, the states of Uttar Pradesh (eastern\nand south-eastern parts), Bihar ,\nJharkhand, O rissa, W est B engal,\nChattisgarh, parts of Madhya Pradesh and\nMaharasthra account for largest number\nof food insecure people in the country.\nHunger is another aspect indicating\nfood insecurity. Hunger is not just an\nexpression of poverty, it brings about\npoverty. The attainment of food security\ntherefore involves eliminating current\nhunger and reducing the risks of future\nhunger . Hunger has chronic and seasonal\ndimensions. Chronic hunger is a\nconsequence of diets persistently\ninadequate in terms of quantity and/or\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n46  \n   Economics\nquality. Poor people suffer from chronic\nhunger because of their very low income\nand in turn inability to buy food even for\nsurvival. Seasonal hunger is related to\ncycles of food growing and harvesting. This\nis prevalent in rural areas because of the\nseasonal nature of agricultural activities\nand in urban areas because of casual\nlabourers, e.g., there is less work for\ncasual construction labourers during the\nrainy season. This type of hunger exists\nwhen a person is unable to get work for\nthe entir e year .\nThe percentage of seasonal, as well as,\nchronic hunger has declined in India as\nshown in the above table.\nIndia is aiming at Self-sufficiency in\nFoodgrains since Independence.\nAfter Independence, Indian policy -\nmakers adopted all measures to achieve\nself-sufficiency in food grains. India\nadopted a new strategy in agriculture,\nwhich resulted in ‘Green Revolution’ ,\nespecially in the production of wheat\nand rice.\nIndira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister\nof India, officially recorded the impressive\nstrides of Green Revolution in agriculture\nby releasing a special stamp entitled\n‘Wheat Revolution’ in July 1968.

This\nprice is called Minimum Support Price\n(MSP) . The MSP is declared by the\ngovernment every year before the sowing\nseason to provide incentives to farmers\nfor raising the production of these crops.\nThe purchased foodgrains are stored in\ngranaries. Do you know why this buf fer\nstock is created by the government? This\nis done to distribute foodgrains in the\ndeficit areas and among the poorer\nstrata of the society at a price lower than\nthe market price also known as Issue\nPrice . This also helps resolve the\nproblem of shortage of food during\nadverse weather conditions or  during  the\nperiods  of calamity.\nWhat is the Public Distribution\nSystem?\nThe food procured by the FCI is distributed\nthrough government  regulated ration\nshops among the poorer section of the\nsociety.  This is called the Public\nDistribution System (PDS). Ration shops\nare now present in most localities,Let’s Discuss\nStudy Graph 4.1 and answer the following\nquestions:\n(a)In which year did our country cross\nthe 200 Million tonne per year mark\nin foodgrain production?\n(b)In which decade did India experience\nthe highest decadal increase in\nfoodgrain production?\n(c)Is production increase consistent in\nIndia since 2000–01?\nlevel has further been ensured with a\ncarefully designed food security system by\nthe government. This system has two\ncomponents: (a) buffer stock, and (b) public\ndistribution system.\nWhat is Buffer stock?\nBuffer Stock is the stock of foodgrains,\nnamely wheat and rice , procured by the\ngovernment  through  the  Food\nCorporation  of India  (FCI) . The FCI\npurchases wheat and rice from the\nfarmers in states where there is surplus\nproduction.

There are\nabout 5.5 lakh  ration  shops  all over the\ncountry. Ration shops also , known as\nFair Price Shops , keep stock of\nfoodgrains, sugar , and  kerosene for\ncooking. These items are sold to people\nat a price lower than the market price.\nAny family with a ration card* can buy a\nstipulated amount of these items (e.g. 35\nkg of grains, 5 litres of kerosene, 5 kgs of\nsugar etc.) every month from the nearby\nration shop.Are there any problems that they face?\nWhy are ration shops necessary?\nThe introduction of Rationing  in India\ndates back to the 1940s against the\nbackdrop of the Bengal famine. The\nrationing system was revived in the wake\nof an acute food shortage during the\n1960s, prior to the Green Revolution. In\nthe wake of the high incidence of poverty\nlevels, as reported by the NSSO in the\nmid-1970s, three important food\nintervention programmes were\nintroduced: Public Distribution System\n(PDS) for food grains (in existence earlier\nbut strengthened thereafter); Integrated\nChild Development Services (ICDS)\n(introduced in 1975 on an experimental\nbasis) and Food-for -Work** (FFW)\n(introduced in 1977–78). Over the years,\nseveral new programmes have been\nlaunched and some have been\nrestructured with the growing experience\nof administering the programmes. At\npresent, there are several Poverty\nAlleviation Programmes (PAPs), mostly in\nrural areas, which have an explicit food\ncomponent also. While some of the\nprogrammes such as PDS, mid-day meals\netc. are exclusively food security\nprogrammes, most of the PAPs also\nenhance food security. Employment\nprogrammes greatly contribute to food\nsecurity by increasing the income of\nthe poor .\n  Suggested Activity\nGather detailed information about some\nof the programmes initiated by the\ngovernment, which have food component.\nHint: Rural wage employment\nprogramme, Employment Guarantee\nScheme, Sampurna Grameen Rojgar\nYojana, Mid Day Meal, Integrated Child\nDevelopment Services, etc.\nDiscuss with your teacher .

Over the years, the policy\nrelated to PDS has been revised to make\nit more efficient and targeted. In 1992,\nRevamped Public Distribution System\n(RPDS) was introducted in 1,700 blocks\nin the country. The target was to provide\nthe benefi ts of PDS to remote and\nbackwar d areas. Fr om June 1997, in a\nrenewed attempt, Targeted Public\nDistribution System (TPDS) was\nintroducted to adopt the principle of\ntargeting the ‘poor in all areas’. It was\nfor the first time that a dif ferential price\npolicy was adopted for poor and non-\npoor .

The functioning of\nthese two schemes was linked with the\nexisting network of the PDS.\nSome important features of PDS are\nsummarised in Table 4.3.\nThe PDS has proved to be the most\neffective instrument of government policy\nover the years in stabilising prices and\nmaking food available to consumers at\naffordable prices. It has been\ninstrumental in averting widespread\nhunger and famine by supplying food from\nsurplus regions of the country to the\ndeficit ones. In addition, the prices have\nbeen under revision in favour of poor\nhouseholds in general. The system,\nincluding the minimum support price and\nprocurement has contributed to an\nincrease in foodgrain production and\nprovided income security to farmers in\ncertain regions.\nHowever , FCI godowns ar e over flowing\nwith grains, with some rotting away and some\nbeing eaten by rats.

Twenty-five\nkilograms of foodgrains were made\navailable to each eligible family at a\nhighly subsidised rate of ` 2 per kg\nfor wheat and ` 3 per kg for rice.

With this increase, 2\ncrore families have been covered\nunder the AA Y.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nFood Security in India  \n   51\nLet’s Discuss\nStudy the Graph 4.2 and answer the\nfollowing questions:\n•In which recent year foodgrain stock\nwith the government was maximum?\n•What is the minimum buffer stock\nnorm for the FCI?\n•Why were the FCI granaries\noverflowing with foodgrains?\nIn 20 22, the stock of w heat and rice\nwith Central pool  is 159 LMT ( Lakh million\ntonnes) of wheat and 104 LMT of rice\nwhich was much more than the\nminimum buf fer nor ms. However , these\nremained consistently higher than the\nbuffer norms. The situation improved\nwith the distribution of foodgrains under\ndifferent schemes launched by the\ngovernment. There is a general\nconsensus that high level of buffer\nstocks of foodgrains is very undesirable\nand can be wasteful. The storage of\nmassive food stocks has been\nresponsible for high carrying costs, in\naddition to wastage and deterioration in\ngrain quality. Freezing of MSP for a few\nyears should be considered seriously.\nThe increased food grains\nprocurement at enhanced MSP# is the\nresult of the pressure exerted by\nleading foodgrain producing states, such\nas Punjab, Haryana an d Andhra\nPradesh. Mor eover , as the pr ocurementis concentrated in a few prosperous\nregions (Punjab, Haryana, W ester n\nUttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and to\na lesser extent in W est Bengal) and\nmainly of two crops— wheat and rice—\nincrease in MSP has induced farmers,\nparticularly in surplus states, to divert\nland from production of coarse grains,\nwhich is the staple food of the poor , to\nthe production of rice and wheat. The\nintensive utilisation of water in the\ncultivation of  rice has also led to\nenvironmental degradation and fall in\nthe water level, threatening the\nsustainability of the agricultural\ndevelopment in thes e states.  Picture 4.5 Farmers Carrying Bags of Grains\nto the  Granaries.+Subsidy  is a payment that a\ngover nment makes to a pr oducer to\nsupplement the market price of a\ncommodity. Subsidies can keep\nconsumer prices low while maintaining\na higher income for domestic producers.\n  #The rising Minimum Support Prices\n(MSP) have raised the maintenance\ncost of procuring foodgrains by the\ngovernment. Rising transportation\nand storage costs of the FCI are other\ncontributing factors in this increase.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n52  \n   Economics\nAs per the NSSO report No. 558 in rural\nIndia, the per person per month\nconsumption of rice has declined from 6.38\nKg. in 2004-05 to 5.98 Kg in 2011-12. In\nurban India, the per person per month\nconsumption of rice, too has declined from\n4.71 Kg in 2004-05 to 4.49 Kg in 2011-12.\nPer Capita consumption of PDS rice has\ndoubled in rural India and increased by\n66% in urban India since 2004-05. The per\nCapita consumption of PDS wheat has\ndoubled since 2004-05 in both rural and\nurban India.\nPDS dealers are sometimes found\nresorting to malpractices like diverting\nthe grains to open market to get better\nmargin, selling poor quality grains at\nration shops, irregular opening of the\nshops, etc. It is common to find that ration\nshops regularly have unsold stocks of poor\nquality grains left. This has proved to be\na big problem. When ration shops are\nunable to sell, a massive stock of\nfoodgrains piles up with the FCI. In recent\nyears, there is another factor that has\nled to the decline of the PDS. Earlier every\nfamily, poor and non-poor had a ration\ncard with a fixed quota of items such as\nrice, wheat, sugar etc. These were sold\nat the same low price to every family. The\nthree types of cards and the range of\nprices that you see today did not exist. A\nlarge number of families could buy\nfoodgrains from the ration shops subject\nto a fixed quota. These included low\nincome families whose incomes were\nmarginally higher than the below poverty\nline families. Now, with TPDS of three\ndifferent prices, any family above the\npoverty line gets very little discount at\nthe ration shop. The price for APL familyis almost as high as open market price,\nso there is little incentive for them to buy\nthese items from the ration shop.\nRole of cooperatives in food security\nThe cooperatives are also playing an\nimportant role in food security in India\nespecially in the southern and western\nparts of the country. The cooperative\nsocieties set  up shops to sell low priced\ngoods to poor people . For example, out\nof all fair price shops running in Tamil\nNadu, around 94 per cent are being run\nby the cooperatives. In Delhi, Mother\nDairy is making strides in provision of\nmilk and vegetables to the consumers\nat controlled rate decided by\nGovernment of Delhi. Amul is another\nsuccess story of cooperatives in milk\nand milk products from Gujarat. It has\nbrought about the White Revolution in\nthe country. These are a few examples\nof many more cooperatives running in\ndifferent parts of the country ensuring\nfood security of different sections\nof society.\nSimilarly, in Maharashtra, Academy of\nDevelopment Science (ADS) has\nfacilitated a network of NGOs for setting\nup grain banks in different regions. ADS\norganises training and capacity building\nprogrammes on food security for NGOs.\nGrain Banks are now slowly taking shape\nin different parts of Maharashtra. ADS\nefforts to set up Grain Banks, to facilitate\nreplication through other NGOs and to\ninfluence the Government’s policy on food\nsecurity are thus paying rich dividends.\nThe ADS Grain Bank programme is\nacknowledged as a succ essful and\ninnovative food security intervention .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nFood Security in India  \n   53\nExercises\n1.How is food security ensured in India?\n2.Which are the people more prone to food insecurity?\n3.Which states are more food insecure in India?\n4.Do you believe that green revolution has made India self-sufficient in food\ngrains?

Summary\nFood security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food\navailable, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there\nis no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food\ninsecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to\ncalamity or disaster . Although a large section of people suf fer from fo od and nutrition\ninsecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households\nin rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers\nengaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are\ndisproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically\nbackward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions\nmore prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of\nthe society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is\ncomposed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In\naddition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which\ncomprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated\nChild Development Services (I CDS); F ood-for -Work (FF W); M id-Day M eals; A ntyodaya\nAnna Y ojana (A AY) etc. I n addition to the role of the government in ensuring fo od\nsecurity, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards\nthis direction.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n54  \n   Economics\nReferencesReferencesReferencesReferencesReferences\nDEV, S.
