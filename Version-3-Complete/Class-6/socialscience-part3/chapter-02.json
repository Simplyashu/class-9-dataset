Looking at the\npopulation from this productive aspect\nemphasises its ability to contribute to\nthe creation of the Gross National\nProduct. Like other resources population\nalso is a resource — a 'hum an resource '.\nThis is the positive side of a large\npopulation that is often overlooked when\nwe look only at the negative side,\nconsidering only the problems of\nproviding the population with food,\neducation and access to health facilities.\nWhen the existing 'human resource ' is\nfurther developed by becoming more\neducated and healthy, we call it 'human\ncapital formation ' that adds to the\nproductive power of the country just like\n'physical capital formation '.\nInvestment in human capital\n(through education, training, medical\ncare) yields a return just like investment\nin physical capital. This can be seen\ndirectly in the form of higher incomes\nearned because of higher productivity\nof the more educated or the better trained\npersons, as well as the higher\nproductivity of healthier people.People as Resource2\nChapter\nIndia’s Green Revolution is a\ndramatic example of how the input\nof greater knowledge in the form of\nimproved production technologies can\nrapidly increase the productivity of\nscarce land resources. India’s IT\nrevolution is a striking instance of\nhow the importance of human capital\nhas come to acquire a higher position\nthan that of material, plant and\nmachinery.\nSource : Planning Commission, Govt. of India.People as Resource2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nPeople as Resource  \n  17\nNot only do the more educated and the\nhealthier people gain through higher\nincomes, society also  gains  in other\nindirect ways because the advantages of a\nmore educated or a healthier population\nspreads to those also who themselves were\nnot directly educated or given health care.\nIn fact, human capital is in one way\nsuperior to other resources like land and\nphysical capital: human resource can\nmake use of land and capital. Land and\ncapital cannot become useful on its own!\nFor many decades in India, a large\npopulation has been considered a liability\nrather than an asset. But a largeLet’s Discuss\n•Looking at the photograph can you\nexplain how a doctor , teacher , engine er\nand a tailor are an asset to the\neconomy?population need not be a burden for the\neconomy. It can be turned into a\nproductive asset by investment in human\ncapital (for example, by spending\nresources on education and health for all,\ntraining of industrial and agricultural\nworkers in the use of modern technology,\nuseful scientific researches and so on).\nThe two following cases illustrate how\npeople can try to become a more productive\nresource:\nStory of Sakal\nThere were two friends Vilas and\nSakal living in the same village\nSemapur . Sakal was a twelve-year -\nold boy. His mother Sheela looked\nafter domestic chores. His father Buta\nChaudhary worked in an agricultural\nfield. Sakal helped his mother in\ndomestic chores. He also looked after\nhis younger brother Jeetu and sister\nSeetu. His uncle Shyam had passed\nthe matriculation examination, but,\nwas sitting idle in the house as he\nhad no job. Buta and Sheela were\neager to teach Sakal. They forced him\nto join the village school which he\nsoon joined. He started studying and\ncompleted his higher secondary\nexamination. His father persuaded\nhim to continue his studies. He raised\na loan for Sakal to study a vocational\ncourse in computers. Sakal was\nmeritorious and interested in studies\nfrom the beginning. With great vigour\nand enthusiasm he completed his\ncourse. After some time he got a job\nin a private firm. He even designed a\nnew kind of software. This software\nhelped him increase the sale of the\nfirm. His boss acknowledged his\nservices and rewarded him with a\npromotion.Picture 2.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n18   \n   Economics\nStory of Vilas\nVilas was an eleven-year old boy\nresiding in the same village as Sakal.\nVilas’s father Mahesh was a\nfisherman. His father passed away\nwhen he was only two years old. His\nmother Geeta sold fish to earn money\nto feed the family. She bought fish\nfrom the landowner’s pond and sold\nit in the nearby mandi . She could\nearn only Rs 150 a day by selling fish.\nVilas became a patient of arthritis.\nHis mother could not afford to take\nhim to the doctor . He could not go to\nschool either . He was not interested\nin studies. He helped his mother in\ncooking and also looked after his\nyounger brother Mohan. After some\ntime his mother fell sick and there\nwas no one to lo ok after her . There\nwas no one in the family to support\nthem. Vilas, too, was forced to sell\nfish in the same village. He like his\nmother earned only a meagre\nincome.  Let’s Discuss\n•Do you notice any difference between\nthe two friends? What are those?Picture 2.2   Stories of Vilas and Sakal\nActivity\nVisit a nearby village or a slum area\nand write down a case study of a boy\nor girl of your age facing the same\ncondition as Vilas or Sakal.\nIn the two case studies we saw Sakal\nwent to school and Vilas did not go. Sakal\nwas physically strong and healthy. There\nwas no need for him to visit the doctor\nfrequently. Vilas was a patient of\narthritis. He lacked the means to visit\nthe doctor. Sakal acquired a degree in\ncomputer programming. Sakal found a\njob in a private firm while Vilas\ncontinued with the same work as his\nmother . He earned a meagre income like\nhis mother to support a family.\nIn the case of Sakal, several years of\neducation added to the quality of labour .\nThis enhanced his total productivity.\nTotal productivity adds to the growth of\nthe economy. This in turn pays an\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nPeople as Resource \n  19\nindividual through salary or in some other\nform of his choice. In case of Vilas, there\ncould not be any education or health care\nin the early part of his life. He spends\nhis life selling fish like his mother .\nHenceforth, he draws the same salary of\nunskilled labourer as his mother .\nInvestment in human resource (via\neducation and medical care) can give high\nrates of return in future. This investment\non people is the same as investment in\nland and capital.\nA child, too, with investments made\non her education and health, can yield\na high return in future in the form of\nhigher earnings and greater\ncontribution to the society. Educated\nparents are found to invest more heavily\non the education of their child. This is\nbecause they have realised the\nimportance of education for themselves.\nThey are also conscious of proper\nnutrition and hygiene. They accordingly\nlook after their children’s needs for\neducation at school and good health. A\nvirtuous cycle is, thus, created in this\ncase. In contrast, a vicious cycle may\nbe created by disadvantaged parents,\nwho themselves uneducated and lacking\nin hygiene, keep their children in a\nsimilarly disadvantaged state.\nCountries, like Japan, have invested\nin human resource. They did not have any\nnatural resource. These countries are\ndeveloped/rich. They import the natural\nresource needed in their country. How did\nthey become rich/developed? They have\ninvested on people, especially in the field\nof education and health. These people\nhave made efficient use of other resources,\nlike land and capital. Efficiency and the\ntechnology evolved by people have made\nthese countries rich/developed.Economic Activities by Men and W omen\nLike Vilas and Sakal, people have been\nengaged in various activities. W e saw that\nVilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the\nfirm. The various activities have been\nclassified into three main sectors i.e.,\nprimary, secondary and tertiary. Primary\nsector includes agriculture, forestry,\nanimal husbandry, fishing, poultry\nfarming, mining and quarrying.\nManufacturing is included in the\nsecondary sector . Trade, transport,\ncommunication, banking, education,\nhealth, tourism, services, insurance, etc.\nare included in the tertiary sector . The\nactivities in this sector result in the\nproduction of goods and services. These\nactivities add value to the national\nincome. These activities are called\neconomic activities. Economic activities\nhave two parts — market activities and\nnon-market activities. Market activities\ninvolve remuneration to anyone who\nperforms i.e., activity performed for pay\nor profit. These include production of goods\nor services, including government service.\nNon-market activities are the production\nfor self-consumption. These can be\nPicture 2.3  Based on the picture can you classify\n  these activities into three sectors?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n20   \n   Economics\nconsumption and processing of primary\nproduct and own account production of\nfixed assets.Education helps individual to make better\nuse of the economic opportunities\navailable before him. Education and skill\nare the major determinants of the earning\nof any individual in the market. A majority\nof women have meagre education and low\nskill formation. W omen are paid low\ncompared to men. Most women work\nwhere job security is not there. V arious\nactivities relating to legal protection is\nmeagre. Employment in this sector is\ncharacterised by irregular and low\nincome. In this sector there is an absence\nof basic facilities like maternity leave,\nchildcare and other social security\nsystems. H owever , women with high\neducation and skill formation are paid at\npar with the men. Among the organised\nsector , teaching and medicine attract\nthem the most. Some women have entered\nadministrative and other services\nincluding job, that need high levels of\nscientific and technological competence.\nAsk your sister or your classmate what\nshe would like to take up as a career?\nQuality of Population\nThe quality of population depends upon\nthe literacy rate, health of a person\nindicated by life expectancy and skill\nformation acquired by the people of the\ncountry. The quality of the poulation\nultimately decides the growth rate of the\ncountry. Literate and healthy population\nare an asset.\nEducation\nSakal’ s education in the initial years of\nhis life bore him the fruits in the later\nyears in terms of a go od job and salary .\nWe saw education was an important  input\nfor the growth of Sakal. I t opened new\nhorizon for him, provided new aspiration\nand developed values of life. Not only for\nSakal, education contributes towards the\ngrowth of society also. I t enhances theDue to historical and cultural reasons\nthere is a division of labour between men\nand women in the family . Women\ngenerally look after domestic chores and\nmen work in the fields. Sakal’s mother\nSheela cooks food, cleans utensils, washes\nclothes, cleans the house and looks after\nher children. Sakal’s father Buta\ncultivates the field, sells the produce in\nthe market and earns money for the family.\nSheela is not paid for the services\ndelivered for upbringing of the family.\nButa earns money, which he spends on\nrearing his family . Women are not paid\nfor their service delivered in the family.\nThe household work done by women is\nnot recognised in the National Income.\nGeeta, mother of Vilas, earned an\nincome by selling fish. Thus women are\npaid for their work when they enter the\nlabour market. Their earning like that of\ntheir male counterpart is determined on\nthe basis of education and skill.Activity\nVisit a village or colony located near\nto your residential area and note\ndown the various activities\nundertaken by the people of that\nvillage or colony.\nIf this is not possible, ask your\nneighbour what is their profession?\nIn which of the three sectors will you\ncategorise their work?\nSay whether these activities are\neconomic or non-economic activities:\nVilas sells fish in the village market.\nVilas cooks food for his family.\nSakal works in the private firm.\nSakal looks after his younger brother\nand sister .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nPeople as Resource  \n  21\n...human being is a positive asset and\na precious national resource which\nneeds to be cherished, nurtured and\ndeveloped with tenderness and care,\ncoupled with dynamism.

The literacy rates have\nincreased from 18% in 1951 to 85% in 2018.\nLiteracy is not only a right, it is also needed\nif the citizens are to perform their duties\nand enjoy their rights pr operly. However , a\nvast difference is noticed across different\nsections of the population. Literacy among\nmales is nearly 16.1% higher than females\nand it is about 14.2% higher in urban areas\nas compared to rural areas. As per 2011\ncensus, literacy rates varied from 94% in\nKerala to 62% in Bihar . The primary school\nsystem (I–V) has expanded to over 7,78,842\nlakh in 2019–20. Unfortunately, this huge\nexpansion of schools has been diluted bythe poor quality of schooling and high\ndropout rates. Samagra Shiksha is a\nsignificant step for the school education\nsector extending from pre-school to Class\nXII, with the broader goal of improving school\neffectiveness measured in terms of equal\nopportunities for schooling and equitable\nlearning outcomes. The scheme envisages\nthe ‘school’ as the continuum from\npre-school, primary, middle to secondary\nlevels and attempts to ensure inclusive and\nequitable quality education from pre-school\nto secondary stage in accordance with the\nSustainable Develompent Goals.  Mid-day\nmeal scheme has been implemented to\nencourage attendance and retention of\nchildren and improve their nutritional\nstatus. These policies could add to the\nliterate population of India.\nThe Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in\nhigher education in the age group of 18 to\n23 years is 27% in 2020–21, which\nwould be broadly in line with world\naverage. The strategy focuses on\nincreasing  access, quality, adoption of\nstate-specific curriculum modification,\nvocationalisation and networking on the\nuse of information technology.

The\nworkforce population includes people from\n15 years to 59 years. Sakal’s brother and\nsister do not fall within this age group so\nthey cannot be called unemployed. Sakal’s\nmother Sheela works for the family. She\nis not willing to work outside her domestic\ndomain for payment. She too cannot be\ncalled unemployed. Sakal’s grandparents\n(although not mentioned in the story)\ncannot be called unemployed.\nIn case of India we have unemployment\nin rural and urban areas. H owever , the\nnature of unemployment differs in rural\nand urban areas. In case of rural areas,\nthere is seasonal and disguised\nunemployment . Urban areas have mostly\neducated unemployment.\nSeasonal unemployment happens\nwhen people are not able to find jobs\nduring some months of the year . People\ndependant upon agriculture usually face\nsuch kind of problem. There are certain\nbusy seasons when sowing, harvesting,\nweeding and threshing is done. Certain\nmonths do not provide much work to the\npeople dependant on agriculture.\nIn case of disguised unemployment\npeople appear to be employed. They have\nagricultural plot where they find work.\nThis usually happens among family\nmembers engaged in agricultural activity.\nThe work requires the service of five\npeople but engages eight people. Three\npeople are extra. These three people also\nwork in the same plot as the others. The\ncontribution made by the three extra\npeople does not add to the contribution\nmade by the five people. If three people\nare removed the productivity of the field\nwill not decline. The field requires the\nservice of five people and the three extra\npeople are disguised unemployed.\nIn case of urban areas educated\nunemployment has become a commonphenomenon. Many youth with\nmatriculation, graduation and post\ngraduation degrees are not able to find\njob. A study showed that unemployment\nof graduate and post-graduate has\nincreased faster than among\nmatriculates. A paradoxical manpower\nsituation is witnessed as surplus of\nmanpower in certain categories coexist\nwith shortage of manpower in others.\nThere is unemployment among\ntechnically qualified person on one hand,\nwhile there is a dearth of technical skills\nrequired for economic growth.\nUnemployment leads to wastage of\nmanpower resource. People who are an\nasset for the economy turn into a liability.\nThere is a feeling of hopelessness and\ndespair among the youth. People do not\nhave enough money to support their\nfamily. Inability of educated people who\nare willing to work to find gainful\nemployment implies a great social waste.\nUnemployment tends to increase\neconomic overload. The dependence of the\nunemployed on the working population\nincreases. The quality of life of an\nindividual as well as of society is adversely\naffected. When a family has to live on a\nbare subsistence level there is a general\ndecline in its health status and rising\nwithdrawal from the school system.\nHence, unemployment has detrimental\nimpact on the overall growth of an\neconomy. Increase in unemployment is an\nindicator of a depressed economy. It also\nwastes the resource, which could have\nbeen gainfully employed. If people cannot\nbe used as a resource they naturally\nappear as a liability to the economy.\nIn case of India, statistically, the\nunemployment rate is low. A large\nnumber of people represented with low\nincome and productivity are counted as\nemployed. They appear to work\nthroughout the year but in terms of their\npotential and income, it is not adequate\nfor them.

I n case of the tertiary sector ,\nvarious new services are now appearing\nlike biotechnology, information technology\nand so on.\nLet us read a story to know how people\ncould become an asset for the economy of\na village.\nStory of a Village\nThere was a village inhabited by\nseveral families. Each family\nproduced enough to feed its members.\nEach family met its needs by the\nmembers making their own clothes\nand teaching their own children. One\nof the families decided to send one of\nits sons to an agriculture college. The\nboy got his admission in the nearby\ncollege of agriculture. After some time\nhe became qualified in agro-\nengineering and came back to the\nvillage. He proved to be so creative\nthat he could design an improved\ntype of plough, which increased the\nyield of wheat. Thus a new job of agro-\nengineer was created and filled in the\nvillage. The family in the village sold\nthe surplus in a nearby neighbouring\nvillage. They earned good profit,\nwhich they shared among\nthemselves. Inspired by this success\nall the families after some time held\na meeting in the village. They all\nwanted to have a better future for\ntheir children too. They requested the\npanchayat to open a school in the\nvillage. They assured the panchayat\nthat they would all send their\nchildren to school. The panchayat,\nwith the help of government, opened\na school. A teacher was recruited\nfrom a nearby town. All the children\nof this village started going to school.\nAfter sometime one of the families\ngave training to his daughter inMoreover , the employment structure\nis characterised by self-employment in the\nprimary sector . The whole family\ncontributes in the field even though not\neverybody is really needed. So there is\ndisguised unemployment in the\nagriculture sector . But the entire family\nshares what has been produced. This\nconcept of sharing of work in the field and\nthe produce raised reduces the hardship\nof unemployment in the rural sector . But\nthis does not reduce the poverty of the\nfamily, gradually surplus labour from\nevery household tends to migrate from the\nvillage in search of jobs.\nLet us discuss about the employment\nscenario in the three sectors mentioned\nearlier . Agriculture, is the most labour\nabsorbing sector of the economy. In recent\nyears, there has been a decline in the\ndependence of population on agriculture\npartly because of disguised unemployment\ndiscussed earlier . Some of the surplus\nlabour in agriculture has moved to either\nPicture 2.6   Can you remember how much did\nyou pay when you asked him to\n             mend your shoes or slippers?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nPeople as Resource \n  27\ntailoring. She started stitching\nclothes for all the families of the\nvillage for everyone now wanted to\nbuy and wear well-tailored clothes.\nThus another new job, that of a tailor\nwas created. This had another\npositive effect. The time of the\nfarmers in going far for buying clothes\nwas saved. As the farmers spent\nmore time in the field, the yield of\nthe farms went up. This was the\nbeginning of prosperity. The farmers\nhad more than what they couldconsume. Now they could sell what\nthey produced to others who came to\ntheir village markets. Over time, this\nvillage, which formally had no job\nopportunities in the beginning, had\nmany like teacher , tailor , agro–\nengineer and many more. This was\nthe story of a simple village where\nthe rising level of human capital\nenabled it to evolve into a place rich\nwith complex and modern economic\nactivities.\n Exercises\n1.What do you understand by 'people as a resource'?\n2.How is human resource different from other resources like land and physical\ncapital?\n3.What is the role of education in human capital formation?\n4.What is the role of health in human capital formation?\n5.What part does health play in the individual’s working life?\n6.What are the various activities undertaken in the primary sector , secondary\nsector and tertiary sector?\n7.What is the difference between economic activities and non-economic activities?\n8.Why are women employed in low paid work?\n9.How will you explain the term unemployment?\n10.What is the difference between disguised unemployment and seasonal\nunemployment?\n11.Why is educated unemployed, a peculiar problem of India?\n12.In which field do you think India can build the maximum employment\nopportunity?\n13.Can you suggest some measures in the education system to mitigate the problem\nof the educated unemployed?\n14.Can you imagine some village which initially had no job opportunities but\nlater came up with many?\n15.Which capital would you consider the best — land, labour , physical capital\nand human capital? Why? Summary\nYou have se en how inputs like education and health helped in making people an\nasset for the economy. The chapter also discusses about the economic activities\nundertaken in the thre e sectors of the economy . We also study about the problem\nassociated with unemployment. Finally the chapter ends with the story of a village\nwhich formally had no job but later had plenty.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n28   \n   Economics\n References References References References References\nGARY, S.
