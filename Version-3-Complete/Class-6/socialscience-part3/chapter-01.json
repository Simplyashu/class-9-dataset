These\nproduction activities need various types\nof resources — natural resources, man-\nmade items, human effort, money, etc. As\nwe read through the story of Palampur ,\nwe will learn how various resources\ncombine to produce the desired goods and\nservices in the village.\nIntroduction\nPalampur is well-connected with\nneighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,\na big village, is 3 kms from Palampur . An\nall weather road connects the village to\nRaiganj and further on to the nearest\nsmall town of Shahpur . Many kinds of\ntransport are visible on this road starting\nfrom bullock carts, tongas , bogeys (wooden\ncart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery\n(gur) and other commodities to motor\nvehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors\nand trucks.\nThis village has about 450 families\nbelonging to several different castes. The\n80 upper caste families own the majority\nof land in the village. Their houses, some\nof them quite large, are made of brick with\ncement plastering. The SCs (dalits)\ncomprise one third of the population and\nlive in one corner of the village and in\nmuch smaller houses some of which are\nof mud and straw. Most of the houses haveelectric connections. Electricity powers all\nthe tubewells in the fields and is used in\nvarious types of small business. Palampur\nhas two primary schools and one high\nschool. There is a primary health centre\nrun by the government and one private\ndispensary where the sick are treated.\n•The description above shows that\nPalampur has fairly well-developed\nsystem of roads, transport, electricity,\nirrigation, schools and health centre.\nCompare these facilities with those in\nyour nearby village.\nThe story of Palampur , an imaginary\nvillage, will take us through the different\ntypes of production activities in the\nvillage. In villages across India, farming\nis the main production activity. The other\nproduction activities, referred to as non-\nfarm activities include small\nmanufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,\netc. W e shall take a lo ok at both these\ntypes of activities, after learning a few\ngeneral things about production.The Story of Village PalampurThe Story of Village Palampur1\nChapter1\nPicture 1.1  Scene of a village\n*The narrative is partly based on a research study by G ilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in W estern\nUttar Pradesh.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2   \n   EconomicsOrganisation of Production\nThe aim of production is to produce the\ngoods and services that we want. There\nare four requirements for production of\ngoods and services.\nThe first requirement is land , and\nother natural resources such as water ,\nforests, minerals.\nThe second requirement is labour , i.e.\npeople who will do the work. Some\nproduction activities require highly\neducated workers to perform the\nnecessary tasks. Other activities require\nworkers who can do manual work. Each\nworker is providing the labour necessary\nfor production.\nThe third requirement is physical\ncapital , i.e. the variety of inputs required\nat every stage during production. What\nare the items that come under physical\ncapital?\n(a) Tools, machines, buildings:  Tools and\nmachines range from very simple tools\nsuch as a farmer’s plough to\nsophisticated machines such as\ngenerators, turbines, computers, etc.\nTools, machines, buildings can be used\nin production over many years, and\nare called fixed capital .\n(b) Raw materials and money in hand:\nProduction requires a variety of raw\nmaterials such as the yarn used by\nthe weaver and the clay used by the\npotter . Also, some money is always\nrequired during production to make\npayments and buy other necessary\nitems. Raw materials and money in\nhand are called working capital .\nUnlike tools, machines and buildings,\nthese are used up in production.\nThere is a fourth requirement to o. You\nwill need knowledge and enterprise to be\nable to put together land, labour and\nphysical capital and produce an output\neither to use yourself or to sell in the\nmarket. This these days is called humancapital. W e shall learn more about human\ncapital  in the next chapter .\n•In the picture, identify the land, labour\nand fixed capital used in production.\nPicture 1.2 A factory, with several  labourers\nand  machines\nEvery production is organised by\ncombining land, labour , physical capital\nand human capital, which are known as\nfactors of production . As we read\nthrough the story of Palampur , we will\nlearn more about the first three factors\nof production. For convenience, we will\nrefer to the physical capital as the capital\nin this chapter .\nFarming in Palampur\n1.Land is fixed\nFarming is the main production activity\nin Palampur . 75 per cent of the people\nwho are working are dependent on\nfarming for their livelihood. They could\nbe farmers or farm labourers. The well-\nbeing of these people is closely related to\nproduction on the farms.\nBut remember that there is a basic\nconstraint in raising farm production.\nLand area under cultivation is practically\nfixed. Since 1960 in Palampur , there has\nbeen no expansion in land area under\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    3\ncultivation. By then, some of the\nwastelands in the village had been\nconverted to cultivable land. There exists\nno further scope to increase farm\nproduction by bringing new land under\ncultivation.larger areas of land more effectively. The\nfirst few tubewells were installed by the\ngovernment. So on, however , farmers\nstarted setting up private tubewells. As a\nresult, by mid-1970s the entire cultivated\narea of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.\nThe standard unit of measuring land\nis hectare, though in the villages you\nmay find land area being discussed\nin local units such as bigha, guintha\netc. One hectare equals the area of a\nsquare with one side measuring 100\nmetres.  Can you compare the area of\na 1 hectare field with the area of your\nschool ground?\n2.Is there a way one can grow more\nfrom the same land?\nIn the kind of crops grown and facilities\navailable, Palampur would resemble a\nvillage of the western part of the state of\nUttar Pradesh. All land is cultivated in\nPalampur . No land is left idle. During the\nrainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar\nand bajra. These plants are used as cattle\nfeed. It is followed by cultivation of potato\nbetwe en October and December . In the\nwinter season (rabi), fields are sown with\nwheat. From the wheat produced, farmers\nkeep enough wheat for the family’s\nconsumption and sell the surplus wheat\nat the market at Raiganj. A part of the\nland area is also devoted to sugarcane\nwhich is harvested once every year .\nSugarcane, in its raw form, or as jaggery,\nis sold to traders in Shahpur .\nThe main reason why farmers are able\nto grow three different crops in a year in\nPalampur is due to the well-developed\nsystem of irrigation. Electricity came early\nto Palampur . Its major impact was to\ntransform the system of irrigation.\nPersian wheels were, till then, used by\nfarmers to draw water from the wells and\nirrigate small fields. People saw that the\nelectric-run tubewells could irrigat e muchNot all villages in India have such\nhigh levels of irrigation.  Apart from\nthe riverine plains, coastal regions in\nour country are well-irrigated.  In\ncontrast, plateau regions such as the\nDeccan plateau have low levels of\nirrigation.  Of the total cultivated area\nin the country a little less than 40\nper cent is irrigated even today.  In\nthe remaining areas, farming is\nlargely dependent on rainfall.\nTo grow more than one crop on a piece of\nland during the year is known as multiple\ncropping. It is the most common way of\nincreasing production on a given piece of\nland. All farmers in Palampur grow\natleast two main crops; many are growing\npotato as the third crop in the past fifteen\nto twenty years.\nPicture 1.3  Different crops\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•The following Table1.1 shows the land\nunder cultivation in India in units of\nmillion hectares.

Why?\n•You have r ead about the crops gr own\nin Palampur . Fill the following table\nbased on information on the crops\ngrown in your region.\nYou have seen that one way of\nincreasing production from the same\nland is by multiple cropping. The other\nway is to use modern farming methodsfor higher yield. Y ield is measur ed as\ncrop produced on a given piece of land\nduring a single season. T ill the mid-\n1960s, the seeds used in cultivation\nwere traditional ones with relatively low\nyields. T raditional seeds needed less\nirrigation. Farmers used cow-dung and\nother natural manure as fertilizers. All\nthese were readily available with the\nfarmers who did not have to buy them.\nThe Green Revolution in the late 1960s\nintroduced the Indian farmer to\ncultivation of wheat and rice using high\nyielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds.\nCompared to the traditional seeds, the\nHYV seeds promised to produce much\ngreater amounts of grain on a single plant.\nAs a result, the same piece of land would\nnow produce far larger quantities of\nfoodgrains than was possible earlier . HYV\nseeds, however , needed plenty of water\nand also chemical fertilizers and\npesticides to produ ce best results.(P) - Provisional Data\nSource:  Pocket Book of Agriculture Statistics\n2020, Directorate of Economics and Statistics,\nDepartment of Agricultur e, Cooperation and\nFarmers W elfare.Year Cultivated Area\n(in Million ctare s)\n1950–51 132\n1990–91 186\n2000–01 186\n2010–11 (P) 198\n2011–12 (P) 196\n2012–13 (P) 194\n2013–14 (P) 201\n2014–15 (P) 198\n2015–16 (P) 197\n2016–17 (P) 200\n050100150200250\n1950-51 1990-01 2000-01 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17\nYear\nCultivated areaCultivated area (in million hectares)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    5•Modern farming methods require the\nfarmer to start with more cash than\nbefore. Why?\n  Suggested Activity\n•During your field visit talk to some\nfarmers of your region. Find out:\n1.What kind of farming methods —\nmodern or traditional or mixed — do\nthe far mers use? W rite a note.\n2.What are the sources of irrigation?\n3.How much of the cultivated land is\nirrigated? (very little/nearly half/\nmajority/all)\n4.From where do farmers obtain the\ninputs that they require?\n3.Will the land sustain?\nLand being a natural resource, it is\nnecessary to be careful in its use.\nScientific reports indicate that the modern\nfarming methods have overused the\nnatural resource base.\nIn many areas, Green Revolution is\nassociated with the loss of soil fertility\ndue to increased use of chemical\nfertilisers. Also, continuous use of\ngroundwater for tubewell irrigation has\nled to the depletion of the water -table.\nEnvironmental resources, like soil fertility\nand gr oundwater , are built up over years.\nOnce destroyed it is very difficult to\nrestor e them. W e must take car e of the\nenvironment to ensure future\ndevelopment of agriculture.\n  Suggested Activity\n•After reading the following reports from\nnewspapers/magazines, write a letter\nto the Agriculture Minister in your own\nwords telling him how the use of\nchemical fertili sers can be harmful.Table 1. 2: Production of pulses and wheat\n( in Million T onnes)\n...Chemical fertilisers provide\nminerals which dissolve in water and\nare immediately available to plants.\nBut these may not be retained in theHigher yiel ds were possible only from a\ncombination of HYV seeds, irrigation,\nchemical fertilisers, pesticides, etc.\nFarmers of Punjab, Haryana and\nWester n Uttar Pradesh wer e the first to\ntry out the modern farming method in\nIndia. The farmers in these regions set\nup tubewells for irrigation, and made use\nof HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers and\npesticides in farming. Some of them\nbought farm machinery, like tractors and\nthreshers, which made ploughing and\nharvesting faster . They wer e rewar ded\nwith high yields of wheat.\nIn Palampur , the yield of wheat gr own\nfrom the traditional varieties was 1300 kg\nper hectare. With HYV seeds, the yield\nwent up to 3200 kg per hectare. There\nwas a large increase in the production of\nwheat. Farmers now had greater amounts\nof surplus wheat to sell in the markets.\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•What is the difference between multiple\ncropping and modern farming method?\n•The following table shows the\nproduction of wheat and pulses in India\nafter the Green Revolution in units of\nmillion tonnes.

Unfortunately , not all\nthe people engaged in agriculture have\nsufficient land for cultivation. I n Palampur ,\nabout one third of the 450 families are\nlandless, i.e. 150 families, most of them\ndalits, have no land for cultivation.\nOf the remaining families who own\nsoil for long. They may escape from\nthe soil and pollute groundwater ,\nrivers and lakes. Chemical fertilizers\ncan also kill bacteria and other micro-\norganisms in the soil. This means\nsome time after their use, the soil will\nbe less fertile than ever\nbefore.... (Source:  Down to Earth, New\nDelhi)\n.....The consumption of chemical\nfertilizers in Punjab is highest in the\ncountry. The continuous use of chemical\nfertilizers has led to degradation of soil\nhealth. Punjab farmers are now forced\nto use more and more chemical\nfertilizers and other inputs to achieve\nthe same production level. This means\ncost of cultivation is rising very\nfast..... (Sour ce: The T ribune,\nChandigarh)land, 240 families cultivate small plots\nof land less than 2 hectares in size.\nCultivation of such plots doesn’t bring\nadequate income to the farmer family.\nIn 1960, Gobind was a farmer with\n2.25 hectares of largely unirrigated\nland. With the help of his three sons\nGobind cultivated the land. Though\nthey didn’t live very comfortably, the\nfamily managed to feed itself with a\nlittle bit of extra income from one\nbuffalo that the family possessed.\nSome years after Gobind’s death, this\nland was divided among his three\nsons. Each one now has a plot of land\nthat is only 0.75 hectare in size. Even\nwith improved irrigation and modern\nfarming method, Gobind’s sons are\nnot able to make a living from their\nland. They have to look for additional\nwork during part of the year .\nYou can se e the large number of small\nplots scattered around the village in the\npicture. These are cultivated by the small\nfarmers. On the other hand, more than\nhalf the area of the village is covered by\nplots that are quite large in size. In\nPalampur , there are 60 families of medium\nand large farmers who cultivate more\nthan 2 hectares of land. A few of the large\nfarmers have land extending over 10\nhectares or more.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    7\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•In the Picture 1.5, can you shade the\nland cultivated by the small farmers?\n•Why do so many families of farmers\ncultivate such small plots of land?\n•The distribution of farmers in India and\nthe amount of land they cultivate is given\nin the following Graph 1.1.

Do you find a similar\nsituation for India? Explain.\n5.Who will provide the labour?\nAfter land, labour is the next necessary\nfactor for production. Farming requires a\ngreat deal of hard work. Small farmers\nalong with their families cultivate their\nown fields. Thus, they provide the labour\nrequired for farming themselves. Medium\nand large farmers hire farm labourers to\nwork on their fields.\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•Identify the work being done on the\nfield in the Pictures 1.6 and arrange\nthem in a proper sequence.\nFarm labourers come either from\nlandless families or families cultivating\nsmall plots of land. Unlike farmers, farm\nlabourers do not have a right over thePicture 1.6 Work on\nthe fields: Wheat crop—\nploughing by bullocks,\nsowing, spraying of\ninsecticides, cultivation\nby traditional method,\ncultivation by modern\nmethod, and cutting of\ncrops.\nSource:  Pocket Book of Agriculture Statistics\n2020 and State of Indian Agriculture 2020,\nDepartment of Agricultur e, Cooperation and\nFarmers W elfare.\nMedium, Semi-Medium &\nLarge Farmers\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n8   \n   Economicscrops grown on the land. Instead they are\npaid wages by the farmer for whom they\nwork. W ages can be in cash or in kind\ne.g. crop. Sometimes labourers get meals\nalso. W ages vary widely fr om r egion to\nregion, from crop to crop, from one farm\nactivity to another (like sowing and\nharvesting). There is also a wide variation\nin the duration of employment. A farmPicture 1.7  The conversation between Dala and Ramkali\nlabourer might be employed on a daily\nbasis, or for one particular farm activity\nlike harvesting, or for the whole year .\nDala is a landless farm labourer who\nworks on daily wages in Palampur . This\nmeans he must regularly look for work. The\nminimum wages for a farm labourer set by\nthe government is Rs 300  per day (March\n2019), but Dala gets only Rs 160. There is\nDala and Ramkali are among the poorest native of the village\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    9heavy competition for work among the\nfarm labourers in Palampur , so people\nagree to work for lower wages. Dala\ncomplains about his situation to Ramkali,\nwho is another farm labourer .\nBoth Dala and Ramkali are among the\npoorest people in the village.\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•Why are farm labourers like Dala and\nRamkali poor?\n•Gosaipur and Majauli are two villages\nin North Bihar . Out of a total of 850\nhouseholds in the two villages, there\nare more than 250 men who are\nemployed in rural Punjab and Haryana\nor in Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, Hyderabad\nor Nagpur . Such migration is common\nin most villages across India. Why do\npeople migrate? Can you describe\n(based on your imagination) the work\nthat the migrants of Gosaipur and\nMajauli might do at the place of\ndestination?\n6.The capital needed in farming\nYou ha ve already se en that the modern\nfarming methods require a great deal of\ncapital, so that the farmer now needs\nmore money than before.\n1.Most small farmers have to borrow\nmoney to arrange for the capital. They\nborrow from large farmers or the\nvillage moneylenders or the traders\nwho supply various inputs for\ncultivation. The rate of interest on\nsuch loans is very high. They are put\nto great distress  to repay the loan.\nSavita is a small farmer . She plans\nto cultivate wheat on her 1 hectare of\nland. Besides seeds, fertilizers and\npesticides, she needs cash to buy\nwater and repair her farm\ninstruments. She estimates that the\nworking capital itself would cost a\nminimum of Rs 3,000. She doesn’t\nhave the money, so she decides to\nborrow from Tejpal Singh, a largefarmer . Tejpal Singh agre es to give\nSavita the loan at an interest rate of\n24 per cent for four months, which is\na very high interest rate. Savita also\nhas to promise to work on his field as\na farm labourer during the harvest\nseason at Rs 100 per day. As you can\ntell, this wage is quite low. Savita\nknows that she will have to work very\nhard to complete harvesting on her\nown field, and then work as a farm\nlabourer for Tejpal Singh. The harvest\ntime is a very busy time. As a mother\nof three children she has a lot of\nhousehold responsibilities. Savita\nagrees to these tough conditions as\nshe knows getting a loan is difficult\nfor a small farmer .\n2.In contrast to the small farmers, the\nmedium and large farmers have their\nown savings from farming. They are\nthus able to arrange for the capital\nneeded. How do these farmers have\ntheir own savings? Y ou shall find the\nanswer in the next section.\n  Let's discuss the story so far ....\nWe have read about the thre e factors of\nproduction—land, labour and capital—\nand how they are used in farming. Let us\nfill in the blanks given below.\nAmong the three factors of production,\nwe found that labour is the most\nabundant factor of production. There are\nmany people who are willing to work as\nfarm labourers in the villages, whereas\nthe opportunities of work are limited. They\nbelong to either landless families or\n. They are paid low wages,\nand lead a difficult life.\nIn contrast to labour , \nis a scarce factor of production. Cultivated\nland area is . Moreover ,\neven the existing land is distributed\n (equally/unequally)  among\nthe people engaged in farming. There are\na large number of small farmers who\ncultivate small plots of land and live  in\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n10   \n   Economicsconditions not much better than the\nlandless farm labourer . To make the\nmaximum use of the existing land,\nfarmers use  and\n. Both these have led to\nincrease in production of crops.\nModern farming methods require a\ngreat deal of . Small\nfarmers usually need to borrow money to\narrange for the capital, and are put to\ngreat distress to repay the loan. Therefore,\ncapital too is a scarce factor of production,\nparticularly for the small farmers.\nThough both land and capital are\nscarce, there is a basic difference between\nthe two factors of production.\n is a natural resource,\nwhereas  is man-made. It\nis possible to increase capital, whereas\nland is fixed. Therefore, it is very\nimportant that we take good care of land\nand other natural resources used in\nfarming.\n7.Sale of Surplus Farm Products\nLet us suppose that the farmers have\nproduced wheat on their lands using the\nthree factors of production. The wheat\nis harvested and production is complete.\nWhat do the farmers do with the wheat?\nThey retain a part of the wheat for the\nfamily’s consumption and sell the\nsurplus wheat. Small farmers like\nSavita and Gobind’s sons have little\nsurplus wheat because their total\nproduction is small and from this a\nsubstantial share is kept for their own\nfamily needs. So it is the medium and\nlarge farmers who supply wheat to the\nmarket. In the  Picture  1.1, you can see the\nbullock cart streaming into the market\neach carrying loads of wheat. The traders\nat the market buy the wheat and sell it\nfurther to shopkeepers in the towns and\ncities .Tejpal Singh, the large farmer , has a\nsurplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all\nhis lands! He sells the surplus wheat at\nthe Raiganj market and has good earnings.\nWhat does Tejpal Singh do with his\nearnings? L ast year , Tejpal Singh had put\nmost of the money in his bank account.\nLater he used the savings for lending to\nfarmers like Savita who were in need of a\nloan. He also used the savings to arrange\nfor the working capital for farming in the\nnext season. This year Tejpal Singh plans\nto use his earnings to buy another tractor .\nAnother tractor would increase his fixed\ncapital.\nLike Tejpal Singh, other large and\nmedium farmers sell the surplus farm\nproducts. A part of the earnings is saved\nand kept for buying capital for the next\nseason. Thus, they are able to arrange\nfor the capital for farming from their own\nsavings. Some farmers might also use the\nsavings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up\nshops. As we shall see, these constitute\nthe capital for non-farm activities.\nNon-Farm Activities in Palampur\nWe have learnt about farming as the main\nproduction activity in Palampur . We shall\nnow take a look at some of the non-farm\nproduction activities. Only 25 per cent\nof the people working in Palampur are\nengaged in activities other than\nagriculture.\n1.Dairy — the other common\nactivity\nDairy is a common activity in many families\nof Palampur . People fe ed their buf falos on\nvarious kinds of grass and the jowar and\nbajra  that grows during the rainy season.\nThe milk is sold in Raiganj, the nearby large\nvillage. Two traders from Shahpur town\nhave set up collection cum chilling centres\nat Raiganj from where the milk is\ntransported to far away towns and cities.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    11\nLet's Discuss\n•Let us take three farmers. Each has grown wheat on his field though the\nproduction is different (see Column 2). The consumption of wheat by each\nfarmer family is the same (Column 3). The whole of surplus wheat this year\nis used as capital for next year’s production. Also suppose, production is\ntwice the capital used in production. Complete the tables.\nFarmer 1\nProduction Consumption Surplus = Capital for the\nProduction – next year\nConsumption\nYear 1 100 40 60 60\nYear 2 120 40\nYear 3 40\nFarmer 2\nProduction Consumption Surplus Capital for the\nnext year\nYear 1 80 40\nYear 2 40\nYear 3 40\nFarmer 3\nProduction Consumption Surplus Capital for the\nnext year\nYear 1 60 40\nYear 2 40\nYear 3 40\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•Compare the production of wheat by the three farmers over the years.\n•What happens to F armer 3 in Y ear 3?

Rarely are\nlabourers hired.\nLet’s Discuss\n•What capital did Mishrilal need to set\nup his jaggery manufacturing unit?\n•Who provides the labour in this case?\n•Can you guess why Mishrilal is unable\nto increase his profit?\n•Could you think of any reasons when\nhe might face a loss?\n•Why does Mishrilal sell his jaggery to\ntraders in Shahpur and not in his\nvillage?\n3.The shopkeepers of Palampur\nPeople involved in trade (exchange of\ngoods) are not many in Palampur . The\ntraders of Palampur are shopkeepers who\nbuy various goods from wholesale\nmarkets in the cities and sell them in\nthe village. Y ou will se e small general\nstores in the village selling a wide range\nof items like rice, wheat, sugar , tea, oil,\nbiscuits, soap, toothpaste, batteries,\ncandles, notebooks, pen, pencil, even\nsome cloth. A few of the families whose\nhouses are close to the bus stand have\nused a part of the space to open small\nshops. They sell eatables.Let’s Discuss\n•In what ways is Kareem’s capital and\nlabour different from Mishrilal’s?\n•Why didn’t someone start a computer\ncentre earlier? Discuss the possible\nreasons.\n4.Transport: a fast developing\nsector\nThere are variety of vehicles on the road\nconnecting Palampur to Raiganj.\nRickshawallahs , tongawallahs,  jeep,\ntractor , truck drivers and people driving\nthe traditional bullock cart and bogey are\npeople in the transport services. They\nferry people and goods from one place to\nanother , and in return get paid for it. The\nnumber of people involved in transport\nhas grown over the last several years.Kareem has opened a computer class\ncentre in the village. In recent years\na large number of students have been\nattending college in Shahpur town.\nKareem found that a number of\nstudents from the village are also\nattending computer classes in the\ntown. There were two women in the\nvillage who had a degree in computer\napplications. He decided to employ\nthem. He bought computers and set\nup the classes in the front room of\ntheir house overlooking the market.\nHigh school students have started\nattending them in good numbers.\nKishora is a farm labourer . Like other\nsuch labourers, Kishora found it\ndifficult to meet his family’s needs from\nthe wages that he received. A few years\nback Kishora took a loan from the\nbank. This was under a government\nprogramme which was giving cheap\nloans to poor landless households.\nKishora bought a buffalo with this\nmoney. He now sells the buffalo’s milk.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nThe Story of Village Palampur   \n    13  Let’ s Discuss\n•What is Kishora’s fixed capital?\n•What do you think would be his\nworking capital?\n•In how many production activities is\nKishora involved?\n•Would you say that K ishora has\nbenefitted from better roads in\nPalampur ?Further , he has attached a wo oden cart\nto his buffalo and uses it to transport\nvarious items. Once a week, he goes to\nthe river Gang a to bring back clay for\nthe potter . Or sometimes he goes to\nShahpur with a load of jaggery or other\ncommodities. Every month he gets some\nwork in transport. As a result, Kishora\nis able to earn more than what he used\nto do some years back.\n Summary\nFarming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have\nbeen many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed\nthe farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an\nimportant achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production\na great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.\nThe new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium\nand large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange\nfor capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who\nconstitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain\ncapital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.\nThe lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own\nsavings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have\nto do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.\nLabour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if\nnew ways of farming used much more labour . Unfortunately , such a thing has\nnot happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour , looking for\nopportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some\nlabour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.\nAt present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every\n100 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.\nThough there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only\nseen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.\nIn the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the\nvillage. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some\namount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?\nOne can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is\nimportant that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without\nsavings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for\nexpansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services\nproduced can be sold. I n Palampur , we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and\ncities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get\nconnected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is\npossible that the opportunities for non-farm activities  in the village would increase\nin the coming years.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n14   \n   Economics Exercises\n1.Every village in India is surveyed once in ten years during the Census and\nsome of details are presented in the following format.
