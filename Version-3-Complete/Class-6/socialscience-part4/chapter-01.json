This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.\nWe hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavor by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development\ncommittee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of\nthe Advisory Group on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\nChief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding\nthe  work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nof this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this\npossible. We are indebted to the institutions and organi sations, which\nhave generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and\npersonnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National\nMonitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and\nHigher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under\nthe Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G. P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organi sation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality\nof its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will\nenable us to undertake further revision and refinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 December  2005 Resear ch and Training\niv\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nAs we live our life in the present and read about the happenings around the world in\nnewspapers, we do not usually pause to think about the longer history of these\nevents. We see c hange before our e y\nes, but do not al ways ask , why are things c hanging?\nVery often we do not even notice that things were not the same in the past. History\nis about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,\nhow the present world in which we live has evolved.\nThe focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary\nworld. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next\ntwo years (Classes IX and X) y ou will see ho w the stor y of India’ s pasts is r elated to the\nlarger histor y of the w orld. We cannot under stand w hat was happening within India unless\nwe see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and\nsocieties have become increasingly inter-connected. History cannot be always contained\nwithin def ined ter ritorial boundaries .\nIn any case there is no reason to think of national territorial boundaries as the only valid unit\nof our stud y. There are times w hen a f ocus on a small r egion - a locality , a villa ge, an island,\na deser t tract, a forest, a mountain - helps us under stand the ric h variety in people’ s lives and\nhistories tha t mak e up the lif e of the na tion. We cannot talk of  the na tion without the\npeople, nor the locality without the nation. Borrowing from the statement of a famous\nFrench historian,  Fernand Br audel,  we may also sa y: it is not possib le to talk of  the na tion\nwithout the world.\nThe textbooks you will read in the next two years will combine these different levels of\nfocus. We mo ve betw een a c lose f ocus on par ticular comm unities and r egions to the\nhistory of the nation; between the histories as they unfold in India and Europe to the\ndevelopments in Africa and Indonesia.  Our focus will shift according\nto themes.\nWhat are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the\nchoices of themes?\nAll too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the\nhistory of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if\nthe histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.\nPeople in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient\nand willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were\nconsidered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change.\nFor many years now these notions have been questioned by historians. We know\nnow that every society has had its history of change. So in understanding the making\nof the modern world we have to look at the way different societies experienced andHistory and a Changing World\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nfashioned these c hanges. We have to see ho w the histories of  these dif ferent countries\nwere inter-linked. Changes in one society shaped the other; developments in India and\nother colonies impacted on Europe. The contemporary world was not shaped by the\nwest alone.\nSo the history of the contemporary world is not only about the growth of\nindustries and trade, technology and science, railways and roads. It is equally\nabout the forest dwellers and pastoralists, shifting cultivators and small peasants.\nAll these social groups in diverse ways have played their part in making the\ncontemporary world what it is. And it is this varied world which you will learn\nabout this year.\nSection I , \nin both books, focuses on some of the events and processes that are\ncritical to the understanding of the modern world. This year you will read\nabout the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and Nazism in this\nsection. Next year you will know about nationalism and anti-colonial movements\nin India  and elsewhere.\nSection II will move from dramatic events to the routines of people’s lives – their\neconomic activities and livelihood patterns. You will see what the contemporary\nworld has meant for forest people  and pastoralists; and how they have coped\nwith and defined the nature of these changes. Next year you will read more\nabout the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, capitalism\nand colonialism.\nTrue, we read a lot about such issues. But what we read does not tell us about\ntheir histories. They give us no idea of how things have evolved and why they\nchange. Once we learn to ask historical questions about all that is around us,\nhistory in fact acquires a new meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from\na different angle. We realise that even seemingly ordinary things have a history\nthat is important for us to know.\nTo know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move\nfrom India to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the\nbig events and important ideas, as well as everyday life. In the process of these\njourneys you will discover how history can be exciting, how it can help us\nunderstand the world in which we live.\nNeeladri Bhattacharya\nChief Advisor – History\nvi\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nMonica Juneja , Professor,  Maria-Goeppert-Mayer Guest Professor,\nHistorisches Seminar, University of Hanover, Germany\nVandana Joshi, Lecturer , Venkateswara  College, University of Delhi,\nNew Delhi\nNandini Sundar, Professor,  Department of Sociology, Delhi School of\nEconomics, University of Delhi,  Delhi\nMukul Kesavan, Professor,  Department of History, Jamia Millia Islamia,\nNew Delhi\nJanaki Nair, Professor,  Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata\nRekha Krishnan, Head  of Senior School,  Vasant Valley School, New Delhi\nRashmi Paliwal, Eklavya, Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh\nAjay Dandekar, Visiting fellow , Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai\nPritish Acharya, Reader , Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar,\nOdisha\nMember–Coordinator\nKiran Devendra, Professor,  Department of Elementary Education, NCERT,\nNew DelhiCHAIRPERSON , A DVISORY  GROUP  FOR TEXTBOOKS  IN SOCIAL  SCIENCE  FOR THE\nSECONDARY  STAGE\nHari Vasudevan, Professor,  Department of History, Calcutta University, Kolkata\nCHIEF  ADVISOR\nNeeladri Bhattacharya, Professor, Centre for Historical Studies, School of Social\nSciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi\nMembersTextbook De velopment Committee\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nAcknowledgement s\nThis book is the result of a collective effort of a large number of historians,\nteachers, and educationalists. Each chapter has been written, discussed and\nrevised over many months. We would like to thank all those who have\nparticipated in these discussions.\nA large number of people have read individual chapters of the book. We\nthank in particular the members of the Monitoring Committee who\ncommented on an earlier draft ; Narayani Gupta and Kumkum Roy who\nprovided constant encouragement and support, and Richard Evans who read\nthe Chapter on Nazism. We have tried to incorporate most of the suggestions\nthat have been made on\n the manuscript.\nIllustrating the book would have been impossible without the help of many\ninstitutions and individuals. The Maasai Association, the North Dakota State\nUniversity Libraries, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the\nUNESCO PARZOR project and the Centre for Women’s Development\nStudies, New Delhi provided photographs and reproductions from their\narchive at very short notice. Some of the pictures have been accessed from\nthe collections of the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division,\nthe Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw, Poland,  Rabindra Bhawan Photo\nArchives, Viswabharati Uni versity, Shantinik etan. Sanja y Bar nela, Mukul Mang alik,\nand Vasant Sa berw al allo wed g enerous access to their lar ge collection of\nphoto g\nraphs of  pastor alists and f orest dwellers.
