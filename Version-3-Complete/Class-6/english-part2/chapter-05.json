He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold,\nfor eyes he had  two bright sapphir es, and a lar ge red ruby glowed\non his swor d hilt.\nOne night ther e flew over the city a little swallow. His friends\nhad gone away to Egypt six weeks befor e, but he had stayed\nbehind; then he decided to go to Egypt too.\nAll day long he flew,\nand at night time he\narrived at the city.\n“Wher e shall I put\nup?” he said. “I hope\nthe town has made\npreparations.”\nThen he saw the\nstatue on the tall column.\n“I will put up  there,”\nhe cried. “It is a fine\nposition with plenty of\nfresh air .” So he  alighted\njust between the feet of\nthe Happy Prince.\n“I have a golden\nbed-r oom,” he said\nsoftly to himself as he\nlooked r ound, and he5. The Happy Prince\nThe Happy Prince w as a beautiful statue. He was\ncovered with gold, he had sapphires for eyes, and a\nruby in his sword. Why did he w ant to part with all\nthe gold that he had, and his precious stones?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nThe Happy Prince/ 29\nprepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a lar ge drop of water fell on him. “What a curious thing!”\nhe cried. “Ther e is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars ar e\nquite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.”\nThen another dr op fell.\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain of f ?” he said.\n“I must look for a good chimney pot,” and he deter mined to fly away.\nBut befor e he had opened his wings, a thir d drop fell, and he\nlooked up, and saw — Ah! What did he see?\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince wer e filled with tears, and tears\nwere running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful\nin the moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity.\n“Who ar e you?” he said.\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n“Why ar\ne you weeping then?” asked the swallow. “Y ou have\nquite drenched me.”\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answer ed the\nstatue, “I did not know what tears wer e, for I lived in the Palace,\nwhere sorr ow is not allowed to enter .  My courtiers called me the\nHappy Prince, and happy indeed I was. So I lived, and so I died.\nAnd now that I am dead they have set me up her e so high that I\ncan see the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my\nheart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep.”\n‘What! Is he not solid gold?’ said the swallow to himself. He\nwas too polite to make any personal r emarks.\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far\naway in a little str eet ther e is a poor house. One of the windows is\nopen, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her\nface is thin and wor n, and she has coarse, r ed hands, all pricked\nby the needle, for she is a seamstr ess. She is embr oidering flowers\non a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids of honour ,\nto wear at the next Court ball. In a bed in the cor ner of the r oom\nher little boy is lying ill. He has a fever , and is asking his mother\nto give him oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river\nwater , so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you\nnot bring her the ruby out of my swor d hilt?  My feet ar e fastened\nto this pedestal and I cannot move.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n30 / Moments\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the swallow. “My friends ar e\nflying up and down the Nile, and talking to the lar ge lotus flowers.\nSoon they will go to sleep.”\nThe Prince asked the swallow to stay with him for one night\nand be his messenger . “The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so\nsad,” he said.\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answer ed the swallow. “I want to go\nto Egypt.”\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little swallow was\nsorry. “It is very cold her e,” he said. But he agr eed to stay with\nhim for one night and be his messenger .\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\nThe swallow picked out the gr eat ruby fr om the Prince’s swor d,\nand flew away with it in his beak over the r oofs of the town.\nHe passed by the cathedral tower , wher e the white marble angels\nwere sculptur ed.  He passed by the palace and hear d the sound of\ndancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover .\n“I hope my dr ess will be r eady in time for the State ball,” she\nsaid. “I have or dered flowers to be embr oider ed on it, but the\nseamstr esses ar e so lazy.”\nHe passed over the river , and saw the lanter ns hanging on the\nmasts of the ships. At last he came to the poor woman’s house\nand looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the\nmother had fallen asleep, she was so tir ed. In he hopped, and\nlaid the gr eat ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. Then\nhe flew gently r ound the bed, fanning the boy’s for ehead with his\nwings. “How cool I feel!” said the boy, “I must be getting better;”\nand he sank into a delicious slumber .\nThen the swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him\nwhat he had done. “It is curious,” he r emarked, “but I feel quite\nwarm now, although it is so cold.”\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.\nAnd the little swallow began to think, and then fell asleep. Thinking\nalways made him sleepy.\nWhen day br oke he flew down to the river and had a bath.\n“Tonight I go to Egypt,” said the swallow, and he was in high\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nThe Happy Prince/ 31\nspirits at the pr ospect. He visited all the monuments and sat a\nlong time on top of the chur ch steeple.\nWhen the moon r ose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n“Have you any commissions for Egypt?” he cried. “I am\njust starting.”\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you\nstay with me one night longer?”\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answer ed the swallow.\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away\nacross the city I see a young man in a garr et. He is leaning over a\ndesk cover ed with papers, and in the glass by his side ther e is a\nbunch of wither ed violets. His hair is br own and crisp, and his\nlips ar e red as a pomegranate, and he has lar ge and dr eamy eyes.\nHe is trying to finish a play for the Dir ector of the Theatr e, but he\nis too cold to write any mor e. Ther e is no fir e in the grate, and\nhunger has made him faint.”\n“I will wait with you one night longer ,” said the swallow, who\nreally had a good heart. He asked if he should take another ruby\nto the young playwright.\n“Alas! I have no ruby now,” said the Prince. “My eyes ar e all\nthat I have left. They ar e made of rar e sapphir es, which wer e\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n32 / Moments\nbrought out of India a thousand\nyears ago.” He or dered the\nswallow to pluck out one of\nthem and take it to the\nplaywright. “He will sell it to the\njeweller , and buy fir ewood, and\nfinish his play,” he said.\n“Dear Prince,” said the\nswallow, “I cannot do that,” and\nhe began to weep.\n“Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow,” said the Prince, “do\nas I command you.”\nSo the swallow plucked out\nthe Prince’s eye, and flew away\nto the young man’s garr et. It\nwas easy enough to get in, as ther e was a hole in the r oof. Thr ough\nthis he darted, and came into the r oom. The young man had his\nhead buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful\nsapphir e lying on the wither ed violets.\n“I am beginning to be appr eciated,” he cried. “This is fr om some\ngreat admir er. Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\nThe next day the swallow flew down to the harbour . He sat on\nthe mast of a lar ge vessel and watched the sailors working. “I am\ngoing to Egypt,” cried the swallow, but nobody minded, and when\nthe moon r ose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n“I have come to bid you goodbye,” he cried.\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you\nnot stay with me one night longer?”\n“It is winter ,” answer ed the swallow, “and the snow will soon\nbe her e. In Egypt the sun is war m on the gr een palm tr ees, and\nthe cr ocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.”\n“In the squar e below,” said the Happy Prince, “ther e stands a\nlittle matchgirl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter , and\nthey ar e all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring\nhome some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nThe Happy Prince/ 33\nstockings, and her little head is bar e. Pluck out my other eye,\nand give it to her , and her father will not beat her .”\n“I will stay with you one night longer ,” said the swallow, “but I\ncannot pluck out your eye. Y ou would be quite blind then.”\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I\ncommand you.”\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down\nwith it. He swooped past the matchgirl, and slipped the jewel into\nthe palm of her hand.\n“What a lovely bit of glass!” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\nThen the swallow came back to the Prince. “Y ou ar e blind\nnow,” he said, “so I will stay with you always.”\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away\nto Egypt.”\n“No, I will stay with you always,” said the swallow, and he\nslept at the Prince’s feet.\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder , and told him\nstories of what he had seen in strange lands.\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but mor e marvellous than anything is the suf fering of\nmen and women. Ther e is no Mystery so gr eat as Misery. Fly over\nmy city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see ther e.”\nSo the swallow flew over the gr eat city, and saw the rich making\nmerry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars wer e sitting at\nthe gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of\nstarving childr en looking out listlessly at the black str eets. Under\nthe ar chway of a bridge two little boys wer e lying in each other’s\narms to try and keep themselves war m. “How hungry we ar e!”\nthey said. “Y ou must not lie her e,” shouted the watchman, and\nthey wander ed out into the rain.\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n“I am cover ed with fine gold,” said the Prince. “Y ou must take\nit off, leaf by leaf, and give it to the poor; the living always think\nthat gold can make them happy.”\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the swallow picked of f, till the\nHappy Prince looked quite dull and gr ey. Leaf after leaf of the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n34 / Moments\nfine gold he br ought to the poor , and the childr en’s faces gr ew\nrosier, and they laughed and played in the str eet. “W e have br ead\nnow!” they cried.\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the fr ost. The\nstreets looked as if they wer e made of silver . Everybody went about\nin furs, and the little boys wor e scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\nThe poor little swallow gr ew colder and colder , but he would\nnot leave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs\noutside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking, and\ntried to keep himself war m by flapping his wings.\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just\nenough str ength to fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once mor e.\n“Goodbye, dear Prince!” he mur mured. “W ill you let me kiss your\nhand?\n“I am glad that you ar e going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,”\nsaid the Prince. “Y ou have stayed too long her e but you must kiss\nme on the lips, for I love you.”\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the swallow. “I am going\nto the House of Death. Death is the br other of Sleep, is he not?”\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down\ndead at his feet.\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as\nif something had br oken. The fact is that the leaden heart had\nsnapped right in two. It certainly was a dr eadfully har d frost.\nEarly the next mor ning the Mayor was walking in the squar e\nbelow in company with the T own Councillors. As they passed the\ncolumn he looked up at the statue. “Dear me! How shabby the\nHappy Prince looks!” he said.\n“How shabby, indeed!” cried the T own Councillors, who always\nagreed with the Mayor and they went up to look at it.\n“The ruby has fallen out of his swor d, his eyes ar e gone, and\nhe is golden no longer ,” said the Mayor . “In fact, he is little better\nthan a beggar!”\n“Little better than a beggar ,” said the T own Councillors.\n“And her e is actually a dead bir d at his feet!” continued the\nMayor . “We must r eally issue a pr oclamation that bir ds ar e not\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nThe Happy Prince/ 35\nto be allowed to die her e.” And the T own Clerk made a note of\nthe suggestion.\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. “As he is\nno longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Pr ofessor\nat the University.\nThen they melted the statue in a fur nace. “What a strange\nthing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. “This\nbroken lead heart will not melt in the fur nace. W e must thr ow it\naway.” So they thr ew it on a dust heap wher e the dead swallow\nwas also lying.\n“Bring me the two most pr ecious things in the city,” said God\nto one of His Angels; and the Angel br ought Him the leaden\nheart and the dead bir d.\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my gar den of\nParadise this little bir d shall sing for ever mor e and in my city\nof gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.”\nOSCAR WILDE\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n36 / Moments\nGlossary\nseamstr ess: a woman who makes a living by sewing\nthimble:  a metal or plastic cap with a closed end,\nworn to pr otect the finger and push the needle in\nsewing\ngarret: small dark r\noom at the top of the house\n1.Why do the courtiers call the prince ‘the Happy Prince’?
