Growth is a characteristic feature of all living beings. You must have seen seeds growing into seedlings, which then grow and develop into plants, or pups growing into dogs, kitten into cats and so on. Similarly an infant passes through different phases of growth from childhood to adolescence to adulthood. Although all the stages of growth and development are significant, it has been universally recognised that the stage of adolescence is the most critical one. \nThis chapter deals with the pattern of human growth with \nspecial emphasis on the growth spurt that takes place during adolescence which means by rapid changes in the body, psyche and behaviour. An adolescent, well aware of pubertal changes, must be able to understand and accept the changes with confidence, and not fall into the trap of escapist strategies such as drug abuse. Growing up with confidence needs proper \nunderstanding of various issues and concerns related to adolescence such as growth and development, self-concept and self-esteem, anxiety and depression, nutritional needs and sexual desires or any kind of harassment. Understanding these issues and concerns will help develop a positive attitude towards gender concerns and building healthy relationships.\n2.2 Growth : A n AturAl  Phenomenon  \nRecognition of adolescence as a distinct stage in the development \nof human beings began during the early part of the 20th \ncentury. Growth during adolescence is mostly portrayed as an exclusive characteristic of this period, making one believe that growth during other stages — childhood, adulthood and old age is hardly significant. But you would have observed that we have all been growing up since we were born without consciously realising it. We can appreciate the phenomenon of growth during all stages of human life by undertaking the following activities.\n2.2.1  What is Growth?\nLet us understand what is growth? Growth may be defined \nas the quantitative increase in size or mass. When weight is measured in kilograms and height in centimetres from time to Growing up with\nConfidence\nBox 2.1\nAdolescence is the period of  transition between childhood and adulthood in human lifespan. It is generally been between 10-19 years of age. It is a period of rapid physical, cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural changes. WHO states that- “there are certain attributes that mark adolescence which include appearance of secondary sex characteristics (puberty), attainment of  reproductive maturity, development of adult mental processes and adult identity and transition from total socio-economic dependence to relate independence”.2\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nGrowing up with Confidence  17\ntime, we can know how much growth has occurred in a child. \nWhen the organs of the body grow, the number, the size and the weight of their cells increase. Growth can be measured in terms of the change in length, width, depth and volume in a specific time period. Although growth is a characteristic of living beings, in all living beings, the rate of growth also depends on nutrition and living conditions, including the environment at home.\n2.2.2\n Growth, Development and Maturation\nGrowth, development and maturation occur side by side. \nGrowth is a quantitative increase in \nsize through increase in \nnumber of cells or elongation of cells. Development may be defined as the progression of changes, both qualitative and quantitative, which lead to an undifferentiated mass of cells to a highly organised state. Maturation is a measure of functional capacity. For example, a child begins to speak by making unintelligible sounds. Then, slowly it acquires the capacity for speaking in a manner, which is easily understood by others. Another example of maturation is when a child begins to crawl and then matures to a state of walking on two legs. Similarly, organs of reproduction reach maturity at the end of puberty.\n2.3 d etermInAnts  of Growth  And develoPment\nAlthough age related events of growth, development and maturation in human beings are mostly the same in all cultures, however, some variations do exist. This is because growth is affected by both genetic and the environmental factors. Growth is also influenced by the socio– cultural context. For example, \nin the economically backward families, the growth of family members gets stunted due to undernourishment. But even in economically sound households, the members may not be taking a nutritious diet. Many children who eat junk food all the time become obese. In fact, growth and development of a human being is a result of a combination of heredity and environment.ActIvIty  2.1\n1. You may collect pictures from old magazines or newspapers and paste them on a sheet of paper to exhibit \nthe life history of a plant or an animal or stages of \nhuman lifecycle beginning from infancy to old age. You may even draw them.\n2. In your diary, list the changes that you have undergone from the time you were nine years old, till now. Mention physical, emotional as well as psychological changes which you experienced. Prepare a write-up on those changes particularly focusing on whether the \nchanges that made you feel surprised or \nstressed till you realised that these changes are normal and natural. You may discuss these changes with your friends. You will realise that these changes during adolescence do not begin at the same age in all the growing children.\nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   17 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n18 Health and Physical Education  — Class IX\n2.3.1  Role of Heredity\nParents contribute genes to their biological offspring, so \nthe children tend to resemble their parents in stature, body proportions, body composition, and pace of growth \nand development. Individual genes, however, are not solely responsible for growth, nor do they directly cause growth. Several genes \njointly control growth. The hormonal and nervous \nsystems also have an important role to play. Hormones from endocrine glands provide the requisite environment for gene action throughout life. For example, growth spurt during adolescence requires the secretion of adequate amounts of growth hormones into blood so that the genes regulating growth of skeleton, muscles and fat become active to the required extent. Because of inheritance, children of tall parents are likely to be tall and children of short parents tend to be short. One needs to understand the role of heredity in the context of development of body physique. Therefore, one should not develop a negative or positive image of oneself on the basis of one’s physique. Also, some individuals have a constitution which makes them look tall (ectomorphic), some medium sized (mesomorphic) and some have a small but rounded built (endomorphic). Thus, a normally growing adolescent should not base self-image on these factors as they are beyond one’s control.\n2.3.2\n Role of Environment\nGrowth and development are also influenced by environmental \nfactors. The role of nutrition, child rearing \npractices and the \npsycho-social environment provided by the family is very critical. \nNutrition: A nutritious diet favours growth. Growth requires \nmultiplication of cells or enlargement of cells, which depends on an adequate supply of nutrients. In fact, at every stage, the body needs a basic level of nutrients for its sustenance. Nutrition is, therefore, the most important external factor for growth. You have learnt in earlier classes in your science lessons that essential nutrients in a human diet are:\n1.\n Proteins and amino acids \n2. Carbohydrates and sugar\n3. Lipids – fats and oils \n4. Minerals – Macronutrients: Calcium, Phosphorus, Sodium, Potassium, Sulphur, Chlorine, Magnesium. \n \nMicronutrients: Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Iodine, Cobalt, Copper, Molybdenum, Nickel. \n5.\n Vitamins – Vitamins are of two kinds\n Fat soluble: Vitamins A, D, E, K \n Water soluble:  Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folic Acid.\n6. Water Box 2.2\nDeficiency of iodine in food causes retardation of mental and physical growth. Can you now explain the importance of consuming iodised salt?\nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   18 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nGrowing up with Confidence  19\nActIvIty  2.2\nRead the following case studies carefully and reflect on the question asked at \nthe end of each case study.\nCase 1: Fourteen years old Suleman and George were very good friends who also \nshared their birth date. Suleman’s parents were quite tall. While Suleman was 5 feet 6 inches tall, George was only 4 feet 9 inches. George wanted to be of the same height as Suleman and would hold on to a rod and hang from it but to no avail. Then they approached the counsellor in school. \nGuess what counselling was given by the counsellor?Case 2: Suresh was a small-built boy studying in Class IX. Not only was he short and \nskinny but also had a tired look on his face. After a medical examination by the school doctor, parents took good care of Suresh. By the time Suresh got into Class\n XI, he \nwas as grown up as his classmates. The doctor gave no medicines to Suresh. \nHow do you think Suresh attained normal growth?Nutrients are obtained from food. \nBoth quality and quantity \nof food are important. Food provides energy, and energy (in kilo calories) is required not only for growth but also for maintenance of the body, its working as well as reproduction.\nA balanced diet contains all the nutrients in appropriate \nquantities. Undernutrition during childhood results in slow growth and delayed maturation. If continued into adolescence, it leads to short stature adulthood. Nutritional needs during adolescence are more than that during childhood. Dietary deficiencies retard the growth. The nutrient requirement however varies among adolescents since rate of physical growth is not the same in all. In populations with food shortage, growth of children is delayed. They may be shorter or of less weight due to malnutrition or undernutrition. \n2.3.3 \n The Psycho-social environment\nThe quality of emotional and psychological environment \nin which a child lives \nand grows do influence the hormonal \nbalance of the body, thereby affecting growth. Growth gets retarded as a result of emotionally stressful environment.\nPhysical and psychological stress together have been found \nto influence growth and development in girls with respect to menarche and menstruation. The age of attaining puberty among boys and girls varies. Some adolescents show signs of early maturation, while others mature late. Highly competitive track athletes who enter training before puberty have been found to show delayed menarche. It is possible to explain the delay due to the elevated levels of certain hormones in blood during severe physical exercise. These hormones delay \nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   19 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n20 Health and Physical Education  — Class IX\nthe onset of menstruation. The \ntiming of menarche is possibly the best researched adolescent event known to be affected by factors like heredity, nutrition, illness, socio-economic status and psychological condition. \n2.3.4  Socio-economic Status Socio-economic status also \naffects growth. Poverty and low socio-economic status lowers the rate of growth in youngsters. Such retarded growth in socially weaker sections of the society is linked to heavy physical \nlabour and the stress associated with it. Malnutrition and an unhygienic environment is also not congenial for growth. \n2.4 s elf-concePt  And self-esteem\nGrowth and development during adolescence do affect self-concept and self-esteem. The concept of ‘self’ becomes evident in boys and girls as they enter their ‘teen’ age. Several changes begin to occur in their body and psyche. As a result, the attention is focused towards ‘self’. As the concept of ‘self’ develops, it makes the teenager develop less dependence on parents. Self-image becomes important not only for oneself ActIvIty  2.3\nRead the conversation between Srinivas and his friend Ali \nSrinivas of Class IX (age 13) who is short and skinny is teased by his classmates, who \ncall him ‘dwarfy’/’bauna’/‘gittha’. Srinivas stops going to school. One day his class friend Ali meets him in the market and enquires about his absence from school. \nAli: A lot has been done in the class and exams are approaching. Why are you not \ncoming to school? Even the teacher was commenting on your absence. I am your friend. Tell me what is wrong. I shall try and help you.Srinivas: He breaks down. We are six siblings living with our parents in a small \nshanty (jhuggi). My father is alcoholic. My mother works harder than her body can allow, for earning some money for the family. There is never enough to eat. We are always fighting. On top of that the bullies of the class tease me. In any case, I need to supplement family income by taking up a job.\nAnalyse the situation, which led to slower growth and natural development in Srinivas.What are the factors affecting the growth of Srinivas?If you are Ali, what will you do.Read the following case study carefully and  \nreflect-Case 3:Neeta and Sheena have been friends since they \nwere five years old. They sit together in class. They come to school together as they are also neighbours. When they were 12, Neeta began to menstruate. Sheena showed breast development but no signs of menarche even when she was 14. Both friends spoke to the teacher about their worry regarding Sheena. \nWhat do you think the teacher said which rid them \nof their anxiety? \nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   20 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nGrowing up with Confidence  21\nbut also in the eyes of others. There is a tendency for looking \ninto the mirror and admiring oneself. Grooming oneself to look beautiful or handsome to others is always at the back of the mind of young boys and girls. \nSupport and guidance from parents and teachers and \nfriendship with peers help in developing ‘positive self-esteem’. Self-esteem is also a kind of self-recognition. It is important for growing up with confidence.\nThe consequences of low self-esteem and self-image are \ndetrimental to efficiency. Try to have high self-esteem and a positive self-image. \nPeer group is important because friends and peers may help \nto sort out confusions regarding rapidly occurring changes in the body. Similar changes in friends of the same age reassure that all is normal. As adolescents grow, they emotionally move further from parents to become independent adults. Acceptance among peers becomes important. Company of wrong peers or adults becomes risky during early adolescence. \n2.5 PsycholoGIcAl  securIty  \nFor developing self-confidence and self-esteem, it is essential to have a stress-free environment. Adolescence is a period of losses—loss of childhood, loss of sexual innocence, loss of freedom from responsibility. Adolescents need parental support to cope with these losses. \nPsychological security depends a lot on how a boy or girl \nwas valued by the family as a child. You may have seen that teenagers who have experienced encouragement from others with respect to values and parental expectations tend to be psychologically more secure than those who are subjected as children to shame and punishment. \nA psychologically secure teenager \nis able to concentrate on studies, have respect for parents, spend time judiciously on hobbies and establish healthy relationships. Adolescence has to be viewed as a period of gains too— the adolescent attains a beautiful physique, figure and face. Another gain is the maturity of brain, which leads to rational thinking and better understanding of subjects and issues. But to ignore the losses and carry the gains forward, support from parents/guardians, teachers, and peers goes a long way in helping the youngsters cope with changes occurring  during adolescence.Box 2.3\nDid you know?\n\tAwareness of \npositive qualities makes one feel good and enhance self-esteem.\n\tWhen we feel good, we respond to every situation more positively.\n\tAppreciating others makes us feel good. \nActIvIty  2.4\nWrite ten sentences on ‘Me — in my own eyes’, in your diary.

Psychologically insecure individuals may even attempt suicide.\n2.6 AnxIety  And dePressIon  \nDuring growing up, adolescents also become victims of anxiety and depression.\n2.6.1  Anxiety   \nAnxiety is not abnormal. Everyone gets the feeling of anxiety \nsometime or the other. Anxiety is an apprehension of something unpleasant or some danger. It causes mental discomfort and pain. It may sometimes prove to be useful, for example, before an examination or competition. But an abnormally high level of anxiety is counter productive as it distracts and lowers the span of attention. Adolescents sometimes panic out of anxiety without knowing the reason. They may even feel a fear of failure in future. This makes them tense and tired. Anxiety may Box 2.4\nRead carefully the following situations and try to respond to the given questions.\nSituation 1: Shalini and her friends in Class IX were preparing for the school’s annual \nfunction. All of them were very excited. Anita, one of Shalini’s classmates, mocked at her, “You are so dark. We will need additional light to be able to see you on the stage.” \nShalini’s good friend, Madhu, felt bad for Shalini and advised her to use a cream to \nmake her complexion lighter. “You already dance so well. Can you imagine how nice you will look on the stage if you had a lighter complexion?”\nShalini smiled and said, “Thank you, Madhu. I appreciate your concern but I am happy \nwith my complexion. My teacher and I am working hard on my dance practice and I am confident that our efforts and your good wishes will lead to a good performance.”\n1.\n What do you think of Anita’s remark about Shalini?\n2.

It may also manifest as over breathing (hyperventilation syndrome). Anxiety may even be due to separation from parents or even for having to attend school out of compulsion or due to sex drive. Adolescents may try to get out of anxiety by self-help. The right treatment for  anxiety lies in seeking help from parents, teachers, counsellors and even friends.\n2.6.2 \n Depression \nFeeling ‘sad’ or low is common among the adolescents. If \nthe feeling is short-lived there is no problem. But sometimes symptoms of depression show up as social withdrawal, need to weep, eating and sleeping problems, and feeling of dejection and hopelessness. Depression at times leads to hostility towards parents, society and peers. ‘Anger’ is sometimes a psychological reaction for fighting depression. If an individual faces pressure, he/she should be empowered \nto access or seek information, \nadvice, support through appropriate communication from significant adults such as the parents, teachers, elders, relatives, peers, counsellors and health professionals. The best way to get out of depression is to engage oneself in various types of physical activities and hobbies. \n2.6.3\n Psychosis \nPsychosis is a medical term for a serious illness in which \nthe patient loses contact with reality. The perception in the patient’s mind has no connection \nwith reality of the outside \nworld. The quality of relationships declines progressively and contact with others lessens with time in a psychotic person. A psychotic may also suffer delusions and hallucinations in which the patient imagines voices and happenings which are far from real. Psychosis may result from abuse of alcohol and drugs, injury and traumatic events. \n2.6.4 \n Suicidal Tendency \nDepression and suicidal tendencies often go together. It is \nunfortunate that often a trivial problem drives a person to  commit suicide. The person feels that it is difficult to run away from unhappiness and death can be the only solution. Suicide in adolescents is mostly due to a sense of guilt or failure. Suicidal behaviour is usually impulsive. It is attempted to punish the self or a loved one. Often suicide is followed by a quarrel with a loved one. It springs from loss of reasoning, which is usually temporary. For teenagers, or for that matter for everyone, it is important, therefore, to think about the consequences \nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   23 08-11-2016   11:05:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n24 Health and Physical Education  — Class IX\nbefore taking any extreme step. The need is to take care of \nsuch adolescents and help them overcome depression. It is the responsibility of the parents to take to the child or consult a counsellor if they see any symptoms of depression before it is too late.\n2.7 d ruG or suBstAnce  ABuse \nYoung people are more vulnerable to drug or substance misuse and abuse due to peer pressure, poor self-esteem, low achievement at school or family history of drug or substance abuse.  Drugs are chemicals. Some are used for treatment and help in recovery from an ailment. But when drugs are used for purposes other than treatment, their consumption becomes ‘drug abuse’ rather than ‘drug use’. Many a time drugs given for medical treatment are also abused as in the case study given below.\nCertain drugs serve no useful purpose; instead have adverse \neffects on the body. Drugs such as Marijuana, hallucinogens and tranquilisers which have an effect on the brain and drive the user into a make believe world of fantasy and provide false feelings of being free from problems. These are not only addictive but also have an adverse effect on the brain. \nActIvIty  2.5\nRead the following case and give your opinion.\nRaman, Robin and Rina, students of Class XII, are good friends.  Robin lives in a \nhostel nearby. He once got a bad cold and cough. The doctor prescribed a cough syrup. Robin was soon cured. When Robin was ill, Raman and Rina used to visit his room regularly to know about his health and extend their help to him. Once, during such a visit, while Robin was taking his medicine he mentioned its good taste. Later, whenever Rina and Raman came to Robin’s room, Raman would taste the cough syrup. He soon acquired such a strong taste that he went and bought the cough syrup for himself from the chemist. Now he has started consuming the syrup everyday and does not feel comfortable if he misses it even on one day. \nAnswer the following questions by giving reasons.1.   Whether taking cough syrup by Robin is ‘use’? Why?2.   Whether taking cough syrup by Raman is ‘abuse’? Why?3.   Think about some other substances which are also abused by adolescents?\nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   24 08-11-2016   11:05:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nGrowing up with Confidence  25\nThe table 2.1 gives the names and groups of drugs and \ntheir affects.\nFollowing symptoms of drug abuse are noteworthy. \nPhysical Symptoms\n•  Reddening and puffiness of eyes, unclear vision \n•  Running nose, congestion, coughing, pale face and dark \ncircles under eyes\n•  Slurring of speech \n•  Nausea, vomiting and body pain \n•  Messy appearance, lack of cleanliness \n•  Drowsiness or sleeplessness, lethargy and passivity\n•  Loss of appetite, significant weight loss or gain \n•  Numerous fresh injection marks on body, \nblood stains \non clothes, profuse sweatingTable 2.1\nGroup Drugs/Substances Effect the user feels\nStimulants Amphetamines (eg. \nBenzedrine, Dexedrine and Methedrine, cocaine, nicotine, tobacco•\n Temporarily accelerate functioning of the brain (central nervous system) and the user may temporarily feel alert and full of energy.\n•\n In higher doses, stimulants may lead to anxiety or panic. \n•\n Mental health problems can occur with increasing use.

As a result, the addicts are not able to undertake their responsibilities and become a liability for their families. Furthermore, it is expensive to buy substances/drugs on a regular basis. Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage in petty crimes. \nThere can never be any need for drugs if one leads a \nmeaningful life with nutritious food, physical exercise, yoga, satisfying occupation and healthy relationships. \n2.8 s exuAl hArAssment  or sexuAl ABuse \nSexual harassment is described as any unwelcome sexual \ngesture or behaviour, whether directly or indirectly–physical contact or advance, showing pornography, a demand or quest for sexual favour, or any other unwelcome physical, verbal/nonverbal conduct. It also includes molestation and rape. It is a criminal act and a punishable offence. Young girls and boys often become target of sexual harassment/abuse by older and powerful people. As per the research, a person who is engaged in sexual abuse of young girls and/or boys is often known to them. Boys are equally vulnerable to sexual abuse. The black mailers usually threat the youngsters of serious consequences if they tell anyone. In such cases, the girl/boy being abused must immediately inform parents/or any trusted member for protection.Box 2.5\nSaying ‘No’ with confidence is the only way to protect oneself from sexual harassment.\nRead about Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act 2012 and Discuss with your classmates\nChapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   26 08-11-2016   11:05:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nGrowing up with Confidence  27\nRead the following case studies and discuss the questions with your friends.\nCase Study 1: Mohit is ten years old.
