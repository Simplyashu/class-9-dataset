W e have not yet discover ed\nwhat causes the motion. Why does the speed\nof an object change with time? Do all motions\nrequir e a cause? If so, what is the natur e of\nthis cause? In this chapter we shall make an\nattempt to quench all such curiosities.\nFor many centuries, the pr oblem of\nmotion and its causes had puzzled scientists\nand philosophers. A ball on the gr ound, when\ngiven a small hit, does not move for ever. Such\nobservations suggest that r\nest is the “natural\nstate” of an object. This r emained the belief\nuntil Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton\ndeveloped an entir ely dif ferent appr oach to\nunderstand motion.In our everyday life we observe that some\neffort is r equir ed to put a stationary object\ninto motion or to stop a moving object. W e\nordinarily experience this as a muscular ef fort\nand say that we must push or hit or pull on\nan object to change its state of motion. The\nconcept of for ce is based on this push, hit or\npull. Let us now ponder about a ‘for ce’. What\nis it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a\nforce. However , we always see or feel the ef fect\nof a force. It can only be explained by\ndescribing what happens when a for ce is\napplied to an object. Pushing, hitting and\npulling of objects ar e all ways of bringing\nobjects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because\nwe make a force act on them.\nFrom your studies in earlier classes, you\nare also familiar with the fact that a for ce can\nbe used to change the magnitude of velocity\nof an object (that is, to make the object move\nfaster or slower) or to change its dir ection of\nmotion. W e also know that a for ce can change\nthe shape and size of objects (Fig. 8.2).\n(a) The tr olley moves along the\ndirection we push it.\n(c) The hockey stick hits the ball forwar d(b) The drawer is pulled.\nFig. 8.1:     Pushing, pulling, or hitting objects change\ntheir state of motion.(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.2: (a) \nA spring expands on application of force;\n(b) A spherical rubber ball becomes oblong\n    as we apply force on it.8\nF FF FFORCE ORCEORCE ORCEORCE     AND ANDAND ANDAND L  L L  L LAWS AWSAWS AWSAWS     OF OFOF OFOF M  M M  M MOTION OTIONOTION OTIONOTIONChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nSCIENCE 88box with a small force, the box does not move\nbecause of friction acting in a dir ection\nopposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction\nforce arises between two sur faces in contact;\nin this case,\n between the bottom of the box\nand floor’s r ough sur face. It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)].\nThere is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving.\nWhat happens when we ride a bicycle?\nWhen we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction for ces acting opposite to the dir ection\nof motion. In or der to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an  object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced for ce. However , it is quite\nincorr ect. An object moves with a unifor m\nvelocity when the for ces (pushing force and\nfrictional for ce) acting on the object ar e\nbalanced and ther e is no net exter nal for ce\non it. If an unbalanced for ce is applied on\nthe object, ther e will be a change either in its\nspeed or in the direction of its motion. Thus,\nto accelerate the motion of an object, an\nunbalanced for ce is r equir ed. And the change\nin its speed (or in the dir ection of motion)\nwould continue as long as this unbalanced\nforce is applied. However , if this for ce is8.1Balanced and Unbalanced\nForces\nFig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal\ntable. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two\nopposite faces of the block as shown. If we\napply a for ce by pulling the string X, the block\nbegins to move to the right. Similarly, if we\npull the string Y , the block moves to the left.\nBut, if the block is pulled fr om both the sides\nwith equal for ces, the block will not move.\nSuch for ces are called balanced for ces and\ndo not change the state of r est or of motion of\nan object. Now, let us consider a situation in\nwhich two opposite for ces of dif ferent\nmagnitudes pull the block. In this case, the\nblock would begin to move in the dir ection of\nthe gr eater for ce. Thus, the two for ces ar e\nnot balanced and the unbalanced for ce acts\nin the dir ection the block moves. This\nsuggests that an unbalanced force acting on\nan object brings it in motion.\nFig. 8.3: Two forces acting on a wooden block\nWhat happens when some children try to\npush a box on a rough floor? If they push the\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 89removed completely, the object would continue\nto move with the velocity it has acquired till\nthen.\n8.2First Law of Motion\nBy observing the motion of objects on an\ninclined plane Galileo deduced that objects\nmove with a constant speed when no for ce\nacts on them. He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter , you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced for\nce of gravity as it r olls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\nGalileo ar gued that when the marble is\nreleased fr om left, it would r oll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight fr om which it was r eleased. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides ar e\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it cover ed while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decr eased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it r eaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane wer e\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zer o), the marble would continue\nto travel for ever trying to r each the same\nheight that it was r eleased fr om. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(exter nal) for ce is r equir ed to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net for ce is\nneeded to sustain the unifor m motion of the\nmarble.  In practical situations it is dif ficult\nto achieve a zer o unbalanced for ce. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional for ce\nacting opposite to the dir ection of motion.\nThus, in practice the marble stops after\ntravelling some distance. The ef fect of the\nfrictional for ce may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes.Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane.\nNewton further studied Galileo’s ideas on\nforce and motion and pr esented thr ee\nfundamental laws that gover n the motion of\nobjects. These thr ee laws ar e known as\nNewton’s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object r emains in a state of r est or of\nunifor m motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force.\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion . In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia.\nCertain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motor car can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\nWe tend to r emain at rest with r espect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking for ce\nto stop the motor car. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nSCIENCE 90or collision with the panels in front. Safety belts\nare worn to prevent such accidents. Safety belts\nexert a force on our body to make the forward\nmotion slower . An opposite experience is\nencountered when we are standing in a bus\nand the bus begins to move suddenly. Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia.\nWhen a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side.\nThis can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. W e tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motor car, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.\nThe fact that a body will remain at rest\nunless acted upon by an unbalanced for ce\ncan be illustrated through the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 8.1\n•Make a pile of similar carom coins on\na table, as shown in Fig. 8.6.\n•Attempt  a sharp horizontal hit at the\nbottom of the pile using another car om\ncoin or the striker . If the hit is str ong\nenough, the bottom coin moves out\nquickly. Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them ‘fall’ vertically on the\ntable.Galileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut his father\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor . Accor dingly,\nGalileo enr olled himself\nfor a medical degr ee at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his r eal inter est in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wr ote his first\nscientific book ‘The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta ]’, in which he described\nArchimedes’ method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays – De Motu , he pr esented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed pr ofessor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of V enice. Her e he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, for mulated the corr ect law for\nunifor mly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is pr oportional to\nthe squar\ne of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a r emarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical per formance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Ar ound 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry\nMessenger’ on his astr onomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter .\nIn his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’\nand ‘Letters on the Sunspots’ , he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and thr ough his\nobservations on Satur n and V enus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 – 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 91five-rupees coin if we use a one-rupee coin, we\nfind that a lesser force is required to  perform\nthe activity. A force that is just enough to cause\na small cart to pick up a large velocity will\nproduce a negligible change in the motion of a\ntrain. This is because, in comparison to the\ncart the train has a much lesser tendency to\nchange its state of motion. Accordingly, we say\nthat the train has more inertia than the cart.\nClearly, heavier or more massive objects offer\nlarger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an\nobject is measur ed by its mass. W e may thus\nrelate inertia and mass as follows:\nInertia is the natural tendency of an object to\nresist a change in its state of motion or of\nrest. The mass of an object is a measur e of\nits inertia.\nuestions\n1.Which of the following ha s more\ninertia: (a) a rubber ball and a\nstone of the same size? (b) a\nbicycle and a train? (c) a five -\nrupees coin and a one-rupee coin?\n2.In the following example, try to\nidentify the number of times the\nvelocity of the ball changes:\n“A football player kicks a football\nto another player of his team who\nkicks the football towar ds the\ngoal. The goalkeeper of the\nopposite team collects the football\nand kicks it towards a player of\nhis own team”.\nAlso identify the agent supplying\nthe force in each case.\n3.Explain why some of the leaves\nmay get detached fr om a tr ee if\nwe vigor ously shake its branch.\n4.Why do you fall in the forwar d\ndirection when a moving bus\nbrakes to a stop and fall\nbackwar ds when it accelerates\nfrom rest?\n8.4Second Law of Motion\nThe first law of motion indicates that when an\nunbalanced external force acts on an object,Activity ______________ 8.2\n•Set a five-rupee coin on a stiff card\ncovering an empty glass tumbler\nstanding on a table as shown in\nFig. 8.7.\n•Give the car d a sharp horizontal flick\nwith a finger . If we do it fast then the\ncard shoots away, allowing the coin to\nfall vertically into the glass tumbler due\nto its inertia.\n•The inertia of the coin tries to\nmaintain its state of rest even when\nthe card flows off.\nFig. 8.7:  When the card is flicked with the\nfinger the coin placed over it falls in the\ntumbler .\nActivity ______________ 8.3\n•Place a water -filled tumbler on a tray.\n•Hold the tray and tur n around as fast\nas you can.\n•We observe that the water spills. Why?\nObserve that a gr oove is pr ovided in a\nsaucer for placing the tea cup. It pr events\nthe cup from toppling over in case of\nsudden jerks.\n8.3Inertia and Mass\nAll the examples and activities given so far\nillustrate that ther e is a r esistance of fered by\nan object to change its state of motion. If it is\nat rest it tends to r emain at r est; if it is moving\nit tends to keep moving. This pr operty of an\nobject is called its inertia. Do all bodies have\nthe same inertia? W e know that it is easier to\npush an empty box than a box full of books.\nSimilarly, if we kick a football it flies away.\nBut if we kick a stone of the same size with\nequal for ce, it har dly moves. W e may, in fact,\nget an injury in our foot while doing so!\nSimilarly, in activity 8.2, instead of aQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nSCIENCE 92 92929292its velocity changes, that is, the object gets an\nacceleration. W e would now like to study how\nthe acceleration of an object depends on the\nforce applied to it and how we measure a force.\nLet us recount some observations from our\neveryday life. During the game of table tennis\nif the ball hits a player it does not hurt him.\nOn the other hand, when a fast moving cricket\nball hits a spectator , it may hurt him. A truck\nat rest does not require any attention when\nparked along a roadside. But a moving truck,\neven at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a\nperson standing in its path. A small mass,\nsuch as a bullet may kill a person when fired\nfrom a gun. These observations suggest that\nthe impact produced by the objects depends\non their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an\nobject is to be accelerated, we know that a\ngreater force is required to give a greater\nvelocity. In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object’s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton. The momentum, p of an object is\ndefined as the product of its mass, m and\nvelocity, v. That is,\np = mv (8.1)\nMomentum has both direction and\nmagnitude. Its dir ection is the same as that\nof velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is\nkilogram-metr\ne per second (kg m s-1). Since\nthe application of an unbalanced for ce brings\na change in the velocity of the object, it is\ntherefore clear that a for ce also pr oduces a\nchange of momentum.\nLet us consider a situation in which a car\nwith a dead battery is to be pushed along a\nstraight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which\nis sufficient to start its engine. If one or two\npersons give a sudden push (unbalanced force)\nto it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push\nover some time results in a gradual acceleration\nof the car to this speed. It means that the change\nof momentum of the car is not only determined\nby the magnitude of the force but also by the\ntime during which the force is exerted. It may\nthen also be concluded that the force necessary\nto change the momentum of an object dependson the time rate at which the momentum is\nchanged.\nThe second law of motion states that the\nrate of change of momentum of an object is\nproportional to the applied unbalanced for ce\nin the direction of force.\n8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL  FORMULATION OF\nSECOND  LAW OF MOTION\nSuppose an object of mass, m is moving along\na straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is\nunifor mly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t\nby the application of a constant for ce, F\nthroughout the time, t. The initial and final\nmomentum of the object will be, p1 = mu  and\np2 = mv  r\nespectively.\nThe change in momentum ∝p2 – p1\n∝mv – mu\n∝m × (v – u).\nThe rate of change of momentum ∝( )× −m v u\nt\nOr, the applied for ce,\nF ∝ ( )× −m v u\nt\n( )× −=km v u\ntF (8.2)\n=  kma  (8.3)\nHere a ∝ = [(v – u )/t] is the acceleration,\nwhich is the rate of change of velocity. The\nquantity, k  is a constant of proportionality. The\nSI units of mass and acceleration are kg and\nm s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so\nchosen that the value of the constant, k\nbecomes one. For this, one unit of force is\ndefined as the amount that produces an\nacceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg mass.\nThat is,\n1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2).\nThus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3)\nF = ma (8.4)\nThe unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton,\nwhich has the symbol N. The second law of\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 93 9393 9393motion gives us a method to measure the force\nacting on an object as a product of its mass\nand acceleration.\nThe second law of motion is often seen in\naction in our everyday life. Have you noticed\nthat while catching a fast moving cricket ball,\na fielder in the ground gradually pulls his\nhands backwards with the moving ball? I n\ndoing so, the fielder increases the time during\nwhich the high velocity of the moving ball\ndecreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of\nthe ball is decreased and therefore the impact\nof catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is\nalso reduced. I f the ball is stopped suddenly\nthen its high velocity decreases to zero in a\nvery short interval of time. Thus, the rate of\nchange of momentum of the ball will be large.\nTherefore, a large force would have to be\napplied for holding the catch that may hurt\nthe palm of the fielder . In a high jump athletic\nevent, the athletes are made to fall either on\na cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to\nincrease the time of the athlete’ s fall to stop\nafter making the jump. This decreases the rate\nof change of momentum and hence the force.\nTry to ponder how a karate player breaks a\nslab of ice with a single blow.The first law of motion can be\nmathematically stated from the mathematical\nexpression for the second law of motion. Eq.\n(8.4) is\nF = ma\nor F( )−=m v u\nt(8.5)\nor Ft = mv – mu\nThat is, when F = 0, v = u\n for whatever time,\nt is taken. This means that the object will\ncontinue moving with uniform velocity , u\nthroughout the time, t . If u is zero then v  will\nalso be zero. That is, the object will remain\nat rest.\nExampl ExamplExampl ExamplExampl eee ee     8.1 8.18.1 8.18.1 A constant force acts on an\nobject of mass 5 kg for a duration of\n2 s.

These two forces ar e always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in dir ection.\nThese for ces act on dif ferent objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a gr eater for ce,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a for ce\nto the other . In other wor\nds, ther e is a pair of\nforces and not just one for ce. The two\nopposing for ces ar e also known as action and\nreaction for ces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a for ce is applied\nthrough the fr ee end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same r eadings on their scales. It means\nthat the for ce exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in dir ection\nto the for ce exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action  and the other as reaction . This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite r eaction. However , it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a r oad. Y ou must\naccelerate, and this r equir es a for ce in\naccor dance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this for ce? Is it the muscular ef fort\nyou exert on the r oad? Is it in the dir ection\nwe intend to move? No, you push the r oad\nbelow backwar ds. The r oad exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and r eaction for ces ar e always\nequal in magnitude, these for ces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each for ce acts on a dif ferent\nobject that may have a dif ferent mass.\nWhen a gun is fir ed, it exerts a forwar d\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nSCIENCE 96What\nyou have\nlearnt\n• First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of\nrest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted\nupon by an unbalanced force.\n• The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their\nstate of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.\n• The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its SI unit\nis kilogram (kg).\n• Force of friction always opposes motion of objects.\n• Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of\nan object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in\nthe direction of the force.Activity ______________ 8.4\n•Request two children to stand on two\nseparate carts as shown in Fig. 8.13.\n•Give them a bag full of sand or some\nother heavy object. Ask them to play a\ngame of catch with the bag.\n•Does each of them experience an\ninstantaneous force as a result of\nthrowing the sand bag?\n•You can paint a white line on\ncartwheels to observe the motion of the\ntwo carts when the children throw the\nbag towar ds each other .\nFig. 8.12:  As the sailor jumps in forward direction,\nthe boat moves backwar ds.\nFig. 8.13\nNow, place two children on one cart and\none on another cart. The second law of motion\ncan be seen, as this arrangement would show\ndifferent accelerations for the same force.\nThe cart shown in this activity can be\nconstructed by using a 12 mm or 18 mm thick\nplywood board of about 50 cm × 100 cm with\ntwo pairs of har d ball-bearing wheels (skate\nwheels ar e good to use). Skateboar ds ar e not\nas effective because it is dif ficult to maintain\nstraight-line motion.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 97• The SI unit of force is kg m s–2. This is also known as newton\nand represented by the symbol N. A force of one newton\nproduces an acceleration of 1 m s–2 on an object of\nmass 1 kg.\n• The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and\nvelocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity.\nIts SI unit is kg m s–1.\n• Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and\nopposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.\nExercises\n1.An object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force.\nIs it possible for the object to be travelling with a non-zero\nvelocity? If yes, state the conditions that must be placed on\n  2. When a carpet is beaten with a stick, dust comes out of it,\nExplain.\n3.Why is it advised to tie any luggage kept on the roof of a bus\nwith a rope?\n4.A batsman hits a cricket ball which then rolls on a level\nground. After covering a short distance, the ball comes to\nrest. The ball slows to a stop because\n(a)the batsman did not hit the ball hard enough.\n(b)velocity is proportional to the force exerted on the ball.\n(c)there is a force on the ball opposing the motion.\n(d)there is no unbalanced force on the ball, so the ball\nwould want to come to rest.\n5.A truck starts from rest and rolls down a hill with a constant\nacceleration. It travels a distance of 400 m in 20 s. Find its\nacceleration. Find the force acting on it if its mass is\n7 tonnes ( Hint: 1 tonne = 1000 kg.)\n6.A stone of 1 kg is thrown with a velocity of 20 m s–1 across\nthe frozen surface of a lake and comes to rest after travelling\na distance of 50 m. What is the force of friction between the\nstone and the ice?\n7.A 8000 kg engine pulls a train of 5 wagons, each of 2000 kg,\nalong a horizontal track. If the engine exerts a force of 40000\nN and the track offers a friction force of 5000 N, then\ncalculate:\n(a)the net accelerating force and\n(b)the acceleration of the train.\n8.An automobile vehicle has a mass of 1500 kg. What must be\nthe force between the vehicle and road if the vehicle is to be\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nSCIENCE 98stopped with a negative acceleration of 1.7 m s–2?\n9.What is the momentum of an object of mass m, moving with\na velocity v ?\n(a) (mv)2(b) mv2(c) ½ mv2(d) mv\n10. Using a horizontal force of 200 N, we intend to move a wooden\ncabinet across a floor at  a constant velocity. What is the\nfriction force that will be exerted on the cabinet?\n11. According to the third law of motion when we push on an\nobject, the object pushes back on us with an equal and\nopposite force. If the object is a massive truck parked along\nthe roadside, it will probably not move. A student justifies\nthis by answering that the two opposite and equal forces\ncancel each other . Comment on this logic and explain why\nthe truck does not move.\n12. A hockey ball of mass 200 g travelling at 10 m s–1 is struck\nby a hockey stick so as to return it along its original path\nwith a velocity at 5 m s–1. Calculate the magnitude of change\nof momentum occurred in the motion of the hockey ball by\nthe force applied by the hockey stick.\n13. A bullet of mass 10 g travelling horizontally with a velocity\nof 150 m s–1 strikes a stationary wooden block and comes to\nrest in 0.03 s. Calculate the distance of penetration of the\nbullet into the block. Also calculate the magnitude of the\nforce exerted by the wooden block on the bullet.\n14. An object of mass 1 kg travelling in a straight line with a\nvelocity of 10 m s–1 collides with, and sticks to, a stationary\nwooden block of mass 5 kg. Then they both move off together\nin the same straight line. Calculate the total momentum\njust before the impact and just after the impact. Also,\ncalculate the velocity of the combined object.\n15. An object of mass 100 kg is accelerated uniformly from a\nvelocity of 5 m s–1 to 8 m s–1 in 6 s. Calculate the initial and\nfinal momentum of the object. Also, find the magnitude of\nthe force exerted on the object.\n16. Akhtar , Kiran and Rahul wer e riding in a motor car that\nwas moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an\ninsect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen.\nAkhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation. Kiran\nsuggested that the insect suffered a greater change in\nmomentum as compared to the change in momentum of the\nmotorcar (because the change in the velocity of the insect\nwas much more than that of the motorcar). Akhtar said\nthat since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity,\nit exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the\ninsect died. Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nFORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 99said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the\nsame force and a change in their momentum. Comment on\nthese suggestions.\n17. How much momentum will a dumb-bell of mass 10 kg\ntransfer to the floor if it falls from a height of 80 cm? Take\nits downward acceleration to be 10 m s–2.\nAdditional\nExercises\nA1.
