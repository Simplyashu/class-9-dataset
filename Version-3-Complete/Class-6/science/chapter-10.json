Living beings\nhave to per form several basic activities to\nsurvive.  W e call such activities ‘life pr ocesses’.\nThe ener gy for these pr ocesses comes fr om\nfood. W e need ener gy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, r eading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running.  Activities that\nare strenuous r\nequir e more ener gy.\nAnimals too get engaged in activities.  For\nexample, they may jump and run.  They have\nto fight, move away fr om enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields.  All such activities\nrequir e ener gy.\nThink of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines r equir e\nfuel like petr ol and diesel?  Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy?\n10.1Work\nWhat is work? There is a dif ference in the\nway we use the ter m ‘work’ in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science.  T o make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\n10.1.1 NOT MUCH  ‘WORK ’ IN SPITE OF\nWORKING  HARD !\nKamali is pr eparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She r eads books,draws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses pr oblems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments.  She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is ‘working har d’. All this ‘har d\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou ar e working har d to push a huge r ock.\nLet us say the r ock does not move despite all\nthe ef fort. Y ou get completely exhausted.\nHowever , you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the r ock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head.   Y ou get tired. Y ou\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Ar e you doing work on the\nload?  The way we understand the ter m ‘work’\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a stair case and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape fr om ther e.  You may even\nclimb up a tall tr ee.  If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function ar e sometimes not consider ed to\nbe work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends\non the way we define it. W e use and define\nthe ter m work dif ferently in science.  T o\nunderstand this let us do the following\nactivities:\nActivity _____________ 10.1\n•We have discussed in the above\nparagraphs a number of activities\nwhich we nor mally consider to be work10\nW WW WWORK ORKORK ORKORK     AND ANDAND ANDAND E  E E  E ENERGY NERGYNERGY NERGYNERGYChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nSCIENCE 114Activity _____________ 10.3\n•Think of situations when the object\nis not displaced in spite of a force\nacting on it.\n•Also think of situations when an object\ngets displaced in the absence of a for ce\nacting on it.\n•List all the situations that you can\nthink of for each.\n•Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is done in these situations.\n10.1.3 WORK DONE  BY A CONSTANT\nFORCE\nHow is work defined in science? T o\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the for ce is acting in the dir ection\nof displacement.\nLet a constant for ce, F\n act on an object.\nLet the object be displaced through a\ndistance, s  in the direction of the force (Fig.\n10.1). Let W be the work done. W e define work\nto be equal to the pr oduct of the for ce and\ndisplacement.\nWork done =force × displacement\nW=F s  (10.1)in day-to-day life. For each of these\nactivities, ask the following questions\nand answer them:\n(i)What is the work being done on?\n(ii)What is happening to the object?\n(iii)Who (what) is doing the work?\n10.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION  OF WORK\nTo understand the way we view work and\ndefine work fr om the point of view of science,\nlet us consider some situations:\nPush a pebble lying on a sur face. The\npebble moves thr ough a distance. Y ou exerted\na for ce on the pebble and the pebble got\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\nA girl pulls a tr olley and the tr olley moves\nthrough a distance.  The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\nTherefor e, work is done.\nLift a book thr ough a height. T o do this\nyou must apply a for ce.  The book rises up.\nThere is a for ce applied on the book and the\nbook has moved.  Hence, work is done.\nA closer look at the above situations\nreveals that two conditions need to be\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a for ce should\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\ndisplaced.\nIf any one of the above conditions does\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\nwe view work in science.\nA bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart\nmoves. Ther e is a force on the cart and the\ncart has moved. Do you think that work is\ndone in this situation?\nActivity _____________ 10.2\n•Think of some situations from your\ndaily life involving work.\n•List them.\n•Discuss with your friends whether\nwork is being done in each situation.\n•Try to r eason out your response.\n•If work is done, which is the for ce acting\non the object?\n•What is the object on which the work\nis done?\n•What happens to the object on which\nwork is done?Fig. 10.1\nThus, work done by a force acting on an\nobject is equal to the magnitude of the for ce\nmultiplied by the distance moved in the\ndirection of the for ce. W ork has only\nmagnitude and no dir ection.\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F\n = 1 N and s = 1 m then\nthe work done by the for ce will be 1 N m.\nHere the unit of work is newton metr e (N m)\nor joule  (J).  Thus 1 J is the amount of work\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nWORK AND  ENERGY 115done on an object when a for ce of 1 N\ndisplaces it by 1 m along the line of action of\nthe for ce.\nLook at Eq. (10.1) carefully.  What is the\nwork done when the for ce on the object is\nzero? What would be the work done when\nthe displacement of the object is zer o? Refer\nto the conditions that ar e to be satisfied to\nsay that work is done.\nExample  10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on\nan object. The object is displaced\nthrough 2 m in the direction of the force\n(Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object\nall through the displacement, then work\ndone is 5 N \n× 2 m  =10 N m or 10 J.Fig. 10.4\nConsider a situation in which an object is\nmoving with a uniform velocity along a\nparticular dir ection. Now a r etarding for ce, F,\nis applied in the opposite direction. That is,\nthe angle between the two directions is 180º.\nLet the object stop after a displacement s. In\nsuch a situation, the work done by the force,\nF is taken as negative and denoted by the\nminus sign. The work done by the force is\nF × (–s) or (–F × s).\nIt is clear from the above discussion that\nthe work done by a for ce can be either positive\nor negative. T o understand this, let us do the\nfollowing activity:\nActivity _____________ 10.4\n•Lift an object up. W ork is done by the\nforce exerted by you on the object.  The\nobject moves upwar ds. The for ce you\nexerted is in the dir ection of\ndisplacement. However , ther e is the\nforce of gravity acting on the object.\n•Which one of these for ces is doing\npositive work?\n•Which one is doing negative work?\n•Give r easons.\nWork done is negative when the for ce acts\nopposite to the dir ection of displacement.\nWork done is positive when the for ce is in the\ndirection of displacement.\nExample  10.2  A porter lifts a luggage of\n15 kg from the ground and puts it on\nhis head 1.5 m above the ground.\nCalculate the work done by him on the\nluggage.\nSolution:\nMass of luggage, m = 15 kg and\ndisplacement, \ns = 1.5 m.Fig. 10.2\nuestion\n1.A force of 7 N acts on an object.\nThe displacement is, say 8 m, in\nthe dir ection of the for ce\n(Fig. 10.3).  Let us take it that the\nforce acts on the object thr ough\nthe displacement. What is the\nwork done in this case?\nFig. 10.3\nConsider another situation in which the\nforce and the displacement are in the same\ndirection:  a baby pulling a toy car parallel to\nthe ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4.  The baby\nhas exerted a for ce in the dir ection of\ndisplacement of the car . In this situation, the\nwork done will be equal to the pr oduct of the\nforce and displacement. In such situations,\nthe work done by the force is taken as positive.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nSCIENCE 116raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece\nof wood, it drives the nail into the wood . We\nhave also observed children winding a toy\n(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed\non the floor , it starts moving. When a balloon\nis filled with air and we press it we notice a\nchange in its shape. As long as we press it\ngently, it can come back to its original shape\nwhen the for ce is withdrawn. However , if we\npress the balloon hard, it can even explode\nproducing a blasting sound. In all these\nexamples, the objects  acquire, through\ndifferent means, the capability of\n doing work.\nAn object having a capability to do work is\nsaid to possess ener gy. The object which does\nthe work loses ener gy and the object on which\nthe work is done gains ener gy.\nHow does an object with ener gy do work?\nAn object that possesses ener gy can exert a\nforce on another object. When this happens,\nenergy is transferred fr om the for mer to the\nlatter . The second object may move as it\nreceives ener gy and ther efore do some work.\nThus, the first object had a capacity  to do\nwork. This implies that any object that\npossesses ener gy can do work.\nThe energy possessed by a n object  is thus\nmeasur ed in  terms of  its  capacity of doing\nwork. The unit of ener gy is, ther efore, the same\nas that of work , that is, joule (J).  1 J is the\nenergy requir ed to do 1 joule of work.\nSometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo\njoule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.\n10.2.1 FORMS  OF ENERGY\nLuckily the world we live in provides energy in\nmany different forms.  The various forms\ninclude mechanical ener gy (potential energy\n+ kinetic ener gy), heat ener gy, chemical\nenergy, electrical ener gy and light energy.\nThink it over !\nHow do you know that some entity is a\nform of ener gy? Discuss with your friends\nand teachers.Work done, W = F × s = mg × s\n=15 kg × 10 m s-2 × 1.5 m\n=225 kg m s-2 m\n=225 N m =  225 J\nWork done is 225 J.\nuestions\n1.When do we say that work is\ndone?\n2.Write an expr ession for the work\ndone when a for ce is acting on\nan object in the direction of its\ndisplacement.\n3.Define 1 J  of work.\n4.A pair of bullocks exerts a for ce\nof 140 N on a plough.  The field\nbeing ploughed is 15 m long.\nHow much work is done in\nploughing the length of the field?\n10.2Energy\nLife is impossible without energy. The demand\nfor energy is ever incr easing.  Where do we\nget ener gy fr om? The Sun is the biggest\nnatural sour ce of ener gy to us. Many of our\nenergy sources ar e derived fr om the Sun.  W e\ncan also get energy fr om the nuclei of atoms,\nthe interior of the earth, and the tides.  Can\nyou think of other sour ces of ener gy?\nActivity _____________ 10.5\n•A few sources of energy are listed\nabove. There are many other sources\nof energy. List them.\n•Discuss in small gr oups how certain\nsources of ener gy ar e due to the Sun.\n•Are ther e sour ces of ener gy which ar e\nnot due to the Sun?\nThe wor d ener gy is very often used in our\ndaily life, but in science we give it a definite\nand pr ecise meaning. Let us consider the\nfollowing examples: when a fast moving\ncricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket\nis thr own away. Similarly, an object when\nraised to a certain height gets the capability\nto do work. Y ou must have seen that when aQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nWORK AND  ENERGY 117Fig. 10.5\n•The trolley moves forward and hits the\nwooden block.\n•Fix a stop on the table in such a\nmanner that the tr olley stops after\nhitting the block. The block gets\ndisplaced.\n•Note down the displacement of the\nblock. This means work is done on the\nblock by the tr olley as the block has\ngained ener gy.\n•From wher e does this ener gy come?\n•Repeat this activity by incr easing the\nmass on the pan. In which case is the\ndisplacement mor e?\n•In which case is the work done mor e?\n•In this activity, the moving tr olley does\nwork and hence it possesses ener gy.\nA moving object can do work.  An object\nmoving faster can do mor e work than an\nidentical object moving r elatively slow. A\nmoving bullet, blowing wind, a r otating wheel,\na speeding stone can do work. How does a\nbullet pier\nce the target? How does the wind\nmove the blades of a windmill?  Objects in\nmotion possess energy. W e call this ener gy\nkinetic ener gy.\nA falling coconut, a speeding car , a rolling\nstone, a flying air craft, flowing water , blowing\nwind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic\nenergy.  In short, kinetic ener gy is the energy\npossessed by an object due to its motion. The\nkinetic energy of an object increases with its\nspeed.\nHow much ener gy is possessed by a\nmoving body by virtue of its motion?  By\ndefinition, we say that the kinetic ener gy of a\nbody moving with a certain velocity is equal to\nthe work done on it to make it acquire\nthat velocity.10.2.2 KINETIC ENERGY\nActivity _____________ 10.6\n•Take a heavy ball.

Why?\n•What has caused the ball to make a\ndeeper dent?\n•Discuss and analyse.\nActivity _____________ 10.7\n•Set up the apparatus as shown in\nFig. 10.5.\n•Place a wooden block of known mass\nin front of the tr olley at a convenient\nfixed distance.\n•Place a known mass on the pan so\nthat the trolley starts moving.James Pr escott\nJoule was an\noutstanding\nBritish physicist.\nHe is best known\nfor his r esear ch in\nelectricity and\nthermodynamics.\nAmongst other\nthings, he\nformulated a law\nfor the heating\neffect of electric\ncurrent. He also\nverified experimentally the law of\nconservation of ener gy and discover ed\nthe value of the mechanical equivalent\nof heat. The unit of ener gy and work\ncalled joule, is named after him.James Prescott Joule\n(1818 – 1889)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nSCIENCE 118 118118118118Let us now express the kinetic energy of\nan object in the form of an equation. Consider\nan object of mass, m moving with a unifor m\nvelocity, u. Let it now be displaced thr ough a\ndistance s   \n  when a constant for ce, F acts on it\nin the dir ection of its displacement.  Fr om\nEq. (10.1), the work done, W\n is F s. The work\ndone on the object will cause a change in its\nvelocity. Let its velocity change fr om u to v.\nLet a be the acceleration produced.\nWe studied thr ee equations of motion. The\nrelation connecting the initial velocity ( u)\nand final velocity ( v) of an object moving\nwith a uniform acceleration a, and the\ndisplacement, s is\nv2 – u2 = 2a s\nThis gives\n2 2v – us =\n2a(10.2)\nFrom section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus,\nusing (Eq. 10.2) in Eq. (10.1), we can write the\nwork done by the force, F as\n× \n  2 2v - uW = m a  \n2a\nor\n( )1\n22 2W = m v – u (10.3)\nIf the object is starting from its stationary\nposition, that is, u = 0, then\n1\n22W = m v (10.4)\nIt is clear that the work done is equal to the\nchange in the kinetic ener gy of an object.\nIf u = 0, the work done will be 1\n22m v.\nThus, the kinetic ener gy possessed by an\nobject of mass, m and moving with a unifor m\nvelocity, v is\n1\n22\nkE = m v (10.5)\nExample 10.3Example 10.3Example 10.3Example 10.3Example 10.3  An object of mass 15 kg is\nmoving with a uniform velocity of              4\nm s–1.

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential ener gy of an\nobject at a point above the gr ound is defined\nas the work done in raising it fr om the gr ound\nto that point against gravity.\nIt is easy to arrive at an expr ession for\nthe gravitational potential ener gy of an object\nat a height.\nFig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\nraised thr ough a height, h fr\nom the gr ound.\nA force is r equir ed to do this. The minimum\nforce requir ed to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W=force ×  displacement\n= mg × h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy ( EP)\nof the object.\nEp = mgh (10.6)\nMore to knowThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose.  An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level.\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\nheights of the initial and final positions of\nthe object and not on the path along which\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\nwhere a block is raised fr om position A to B\nby taking two dif ferent paths. Let the height\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\non the object is mgh.\nFig. 10.8\nExample 10.5  Find the energy possessed\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\na height of 6 m above the gr ound. Given,\ng = 9.8 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m = 10 kg,\ndisplacement (height), h = 6 m, and\nacceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2.\nFrom Eq. (10.6),\nPotential ener\ngy = mgh\n=10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m\n=588 J.\nThe potential ener gy  is 588 J.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nWORK AND  ENERGY 121Example 10.6  An object of mass 12 kg is\nat a certain height above the gr ound.\nIf the  potential ener gy of the object is\n480 J, find the height at which the\nobject is with r espect to the gr ound.\nGiven,  g\n = 10 m s–2.\nSolution:\nMass of the object, m  = 12 kg,\npotential energy, Ep = 480 J.\n     Ep=mgh\n480 J =12 kg ×  10 m s–2 × h\n      h = –2480 J\n120 kg ms = 4 m.\nThe object is at the height of 4 m.\n10.2.5 ARE VARIOUS\n ENERGY FORMS\nINTERCONVERTIBLE ?\nCan we convert ener gy fr om one for m to\nanother? W e find in natur e a number of\ninstances of conversion of ener gy from one\nform to another .\nActivity ___________ 10.13\n•Sit in small groups.\n•Discuss the various ways of ener gy\nconversion in natur e.\n•Discuss following questions in your\ngroup:\n(a)How do gr een plants pr oduce food?\n(b)Wher e do they get their ener gy from?\n(c)Why does the air move fr om place\nto place?\n(d)How ar e fuels, such as coal and\npetroleum for med?\n(e)What kinds of energy conversions\nsustain the water cycle?\nActivity ___________ 10.14\n•Many of the human activities and the\ngadgets we use involve conversion of\nenergy from one for m to another .\n•Make a list of such activities and\ngadgets.\n•Identify in each activity/gadget the\nkind of energy conversion that takes\nplace.10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF ENERGY\nIn activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that\nthe form of energy can be changed from one\nform to another . What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is  mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v  will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1constant.\n22mgh + mv = (10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the fr ee fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nSCIENCE 122A stronger person may do certain work in\nrelatively less time. A more powerful vehicle\nwould complete a journey in a shorter time\nthan a less power ful one. W e talk of the power\nof machines like motorbikes and motor cars.\nThe speed with which these vehicles change\nenergy or do work is a basis for their\nclassification.  Power measur es the speed of\nwork done, that is, how fast or slow work is\ndone. Power is defined as the rate of doing\nwork or the rate of transfer of ener gy. If an\nagent does a work W  in time t, then power is\ngiven by:\nPower = work/time\norWP =\nt(10.8)\nThe unit of power is watt [in honour of\nJames W att (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol\nW. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which\ndoes work at the rate of 1 joule per second.\nWe can also say that power is 1 W when the\nrate of consumption of ener gy is    1 J s–1.\n1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1.\nWe expr ess lar ger rates of ener gy transfer in\nkilowatts (kW).\n1 kilowatt =1000 watts\n1 kW =1000 W\n1 kW =1000 J s–1.\nThe power of an agent may vary with time.\nThis means that the agent may be doing work\nat dif ferent rates at dif ferent intervals of time.\nTherefore the concept of average power is\nuseful. W e obtain average power by dividing\nthe total energy consumed by the total time\ntaken.\nExample 10.7  Two girls, each of weight 400\nN climb up a rope through a height of 8\nm.

Do you agree with this?\n10.3Rate of Doing Work\nDo all of us work at the same rate? Do\nmachines consume or transfer ener gy at the\nsame rate? Agents that transfer ener gy do\nwork at dif ferent rates.

The unit of work is joule:\n1 joule = 1 newton ×  1 metre.\n• Work done on an object by a for ce would be zer o if the\ndisplacement of the object is zero.\n• An object having capability to do work is said to possess\nenergy. Energy has the same unit as that of work.\n• An object in motion possesses what is known as the kinetic\nenergy of the object. An object of mass, m moving with\nvelocity \nv has a kinetic energy of 2mv1\n2.\n• The energy possessed by a body due to its change in position\nor shape is called the potential energy. The gravitational\npotential energy of an object of mass, m raised through a\nheight, h from the earth’s surface is given by m g h\n.\n• According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can\nonly be transformed from one form to another; it can neither\nbe created nor destroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation always remains constant.\n• Energy exists in nature in several forms such as kinetic\nenergy, potential energy, heat energy, chemical energy etc.\nThe sum of the kinetic and potential energies of an object is\ncalled its mechanical energy.\n• Power is defined as the rate of doing work.
