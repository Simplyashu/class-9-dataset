They were very happy as Samayra was fond of photography and Shirom was good at writing articles. Samayra took pictures throughout the day and in the evening they both sat down to check those pictures. When they saw \nFig 3.1 : Village melaChapter  \n2Chapter  \n1Creating Visual\nCommunicationChapter\n3\nChapter 3.indd   39 27-Feb-19   4:41:56 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix40the pictures they were not happy as the pictures were a \nlittle dull and not focussed properly.\nShirom: Samayra, don't get upset I am familiar with a \ngraphics editor software  which will help us in modifying and enhancing these images. \nSamayra: Shirom, do you know editing can also be done \nwith a smartphone.\nShirom: Yes Samayra, you are absolutely correct, but \nI know a Free and Open Source Graphics Editing Tool which can help us to enhance images we have.\nCheck Yourself\nWhat needs to be checked for selecting a picture for an article?\n(a)  Clarity of picture\n(b)  Information in the picture(c)  Size of the picture(d)  Any other ______\nShirom: Samayra, now tell me what modifications you \nwant in these images. I will demonstrate how we can use various features of the graphics editor for modifications in these images.\nShirom: Let's first open the image we want to modify. \n(Refer Fig. 3.2).\nFig 3.2: Opening an image\nCanvas  is the area \nwhere you insert and modify an image. A canvas can havemany layers. A layer comprises oneimage. The Newoption of File menu also opens a new canvas where we can mention the size of the image. The size of an image is measured in pixels. A pixel is thesmallest illuminated area on a screen.\nGIMP is a multimedia \ntool suitable for avariety of imagemanipulation tasks,such as  photo editing, collage creation and free from drawing. GIMP stores an image in  .xcf format.\nChapter 3.indd   40 27-Feb-19   4:41:58 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation41Samayra: Shirom, see this image. It contains some \nunwanted areas which I don't want. Refer Fig. 3.3.\nShirom: Don't worry Samayra let me tell you how you \ncan remove the unwanted area of the picture. This is known as cropping as shown in Fig. 3.4.\nFig. 3.3: Image showing unwanted area\nFig. 3.4: Cropping an image\nChapter 3.indd   41 7/16/2020   2:39:24 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix42Samayra: Yes Shirom, this is exactly what I wanted.\nMoving the mouse pointer over the tool in the toolbox, \nas shown in Fig. 3.5 and letting it rest for a moment, usually displays a ‘tooltip’ that describes its usage. Short cut keys are also frequently shown in the tooltip. In many cases, you can hover the mouse over an item and press the F1 key to get help about the tool that is underneath the mouse.Shirom: Samayra, let me now tell you how to create a copy of an image. For this we will have to create a new layer. Refer Fig. 3.6 to add, a new layer.\n    Fig. 3.5 : Tool Box\nA Toolbox is an area \nwhich contains tools to perform basic tasks. Tools can be added or removed as per our requirements. The toolbox is placed by default on the left side when you open GIMP interface.One can also select the portion to be cropped by using ToolsSelection Tools     Rectangle Select.Select and then select Image  Crop to Selection to crop an image.\nChapter 3.indd   42 7/16/2020   2:39:24 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation43Paste the copied image to new layer using Edit  → Paste \nas → New Layer.\nA new layer with the image is created on top of the \nprevious layer. Click on the image and using the Move Tool to move the image to right side of the existing i mage.\nFig. 3.7 : Copied image\n  Fig. 3.6 : Layering an Image\nChapter 3.indd   43 27-Feb-19   4:42:01 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix44Samayra: Shirom, I was thinking of creating a replica of \nthis image but in the opposite direction.\nShirom: Oh, that's known as flipping an image.\nTo do that we first need a copy of the image you want to \nflip. Refer Fig. 3.8 to flip an image.\nBefore flipping\nshould a copy of\nthe image be kept?\nFig. 3.8: Flipping an image\nFig. 3.9: Flipped image\nChapter 3.indd   44 27-Feb-19   4:42:03 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation45Shirom: Samayra, just like flipping we can also rotate \nan image. Refer Fig. 3.10 to rotate an image. \nFig. 3.10: Rotating an image\nCheck Yourself\nDownload an image of a flower.\n1. Create a copy of this image.2. Use the shortcut key to crop certain areas of this \nimage \n    which you think are not required.3. Flip the cropped image vertically.4. Rotate the flipped image by 90 degrees.\nShirom: Another important aspect is to reduce the size of an image so that it can be mailed or  used for any other purpose. The solution for this is to scale the image. Scaling down is the process of reducing the size of an image. This will change the number of pixels it \nChapter 3.indd   45 27-Feb-19   4:42:04 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix46contains and resize the canvas accordingly. An image \ncan be scaled in two ways. \na)  Using Tools  → Transform Tools. Refer Fig. 3.11(a) \nb) Using Image  → Scale Image. Refer Fig. 3.11(b)\nFig. 3.11(a): Scaling an image using Tools menu\nFig. 3.11(b): Scaling an image using Image menu\nChapter 3.indd   46 27-Feb-19   4:42:06 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation47Shirom: So, now another important feature of GIMP is \nthe brightness control tool which helps us in enhancing an image. Let me tell you about how to use this feature to make dull images bright. Refer Fig 3.12 to brighten  \nan image.\nDPI stands for Dots Per Inch which technically means Printer resolution. Today, it is a term often misused, usually to mean PPI, which stands for Pixels per Inch which is the display resolution. Higher the resolution better the printing quality.\nFig. 3.12: Brightening an image\nShirom: Samayra, let me now tell you another very interesting feature with the help of which I will create the reflection of an image.\nSamayra: Oh that's great! Shirom, this will further help \nus to enhance our images.\nSamayra: Shirom, I want you to reflect the given image  \n(Refer Fig. 3.13).\nChapter 3.indd   47 27-Feb-19   4:42:07 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix48Shirom: Samayra, now I will describe the steps to reflect \nan image.\n1.  Create a new file (1080  × 760) with a transparent \nbackground. The transparent background can be given by choosing Transparency option in Fill with from Advanced Options while creating a new image. Refer Fig. 3.14.\n2. Copy the image you want to reflect and drag it on \ntop with the Move Tool and Scale to its half of the image canvas size in Height.\n3. Duplicate the layer by right clicking on the layer \nof the image then choose  — Duplicate Layer.\n4. Flip vertically the copied image, using the Flip \nTool. The duplicate layer with flipped image is added on top of the existing  layer.\n5. Drag the new flipped image just below the original \nimage. (Refer Fig. 3.15).\nLayer palette displays \nall the layers in thecanvas and can be made visible by choosing Windows -> Dockable Dialogs -> Layers.\nFig. 3.13: Image to be reflected\nChapter 3.indd   48 27-Feb-19   4:42:07 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation496. Right click on the new layer in the Layer palette \nand click on Add Layer Mask and choose White \n(for full opacity). Click on Add. (Refer Fig. 3.16).\n7. Add a gradient with the Blend Tool and to be more \nprecise, click on Ctrl key while using this.\n8. In the Layer Window set the opacity of the new \nlayer to 65% and right click on the layer to Merge it down (Refer Fig. 3.17).\n9. Click on the vertical rule and drag mouse and add \na perspective by choosing the Perspective tool.\nFig. 3.15: Flipped layer of an image\n Fig. 3.14 Creating an image with transparency\nFig. 3.16: Layer palette\n Fig. 3.17: Merging down a layer from layer palette\nChapter 3.indd   49 27-Feb-19   4:42:09 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix50Samayra: The reflected image looks so beautiful (Refer \nFig. 3.18).\nShirom: Samayra, now I will tell you how to add text \nwith effects as an image.\nFor adding text as an image follow the given steps:\n1. Create a new image of appropriate size (256 x 128 \nfor the logo/caption/heading/title.\n2. Set the Background colour of the canvas to black \nby changing the RGB values to (0,0,0).\nFig. 3.18: Reflected image\nChapter 3.indd   50 27-Feb-19   4:42:09 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation513. After setting the RGB values choose the Bucket \nFill Tool, \n  to fill colour in the canvas.\n4. Now choose the Text tool from the toolbox.\n5. Next step is to change the foreground to white \nRGB (255, 255, 255) as on black canvas white \ncoloured text will be visible clearly.\n6. After setting the text boundary type in the \nrequired text. “A VILLAGE MELA”. The text will be added as a new layer (Refer Fig. 3.19). The Layer palette will have two layers now. The newly added text layer and the background layer.\n7. Now right click on the new canvas with text and \nchoose New from Visible option. This again adds a third layer with the name “Visible” in the layer palette (Refer Fig. 3.20).\n8. Give effects to text as per your requirement by \nchoosing Filter→Blur. Here we are invoking the Gaussian Blur.\n9. Now, I am going to add a new layer with \nplasma effect. To add plasma effect choose \nFilter  → Render  → Clouds Plasma effect. (Refer \nFig. 3.21).\n10. The next step is to generate a fake 3D shape \non this plasma layer. The process is known as \n‘bump mapping’. To do this select Filter  → Map →  \nBump Map.\n11. Now, I will isolate our bump mapped text. For \nthe same add a Layered Mask with White (Full \nOpacity) to the plasma layer:  Laye r → Mask  → \nAdd Layer Mask. (alternatively Right‑Click on the plasma layer and choose “Add Layer Mask…”).\n12. Now, copy the ‘Visible’ layer and paste it into the \nlayer mask for the plasma layer.\n13. Make plasma layer active by Left ‑Clicking on it \nand Paste the “Visible” layer on it. Edit→Paste. This will now insert a Floating Selection (Pasted Layer) into your image.\n14. The next step is to get this Floating Selection into \nthe mask so we need to Anchor it by choosing \nLayer  → Anchor Layer.\nChapter 3.indd   51 7/16/2020   2:39:55 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix52\nFig. 3.19: Text as an image\nFig. 3.22: Text as an image\nFig. 3.20: Layer palette with three layers\nFig. 3.21: Layer with plasma effect\nFinally, save the file by clicking \non the File Menu  → Save As and \nthen give the name of the file (for \nexample, Myfair1). The final image can be seen in Fig. 3.22. By default the image is saved in .XCF Format. Close the image file once you finish working on it by clicking on File \nMenu  → Close View or Close All.\nSamayra: Shirom, I don't like the red color of the text on the board of the given image. (Refer Fig. 3.23).\nHow to remove the\ntext and merge it\nwith the background?\nFig. 3.23: Image with unwanted\nShirom: No problem Samayra. GIMP has a feature with which you can remove patches and merge it with the \nChapter 3.indd   52 27-Feb-19   4:42:11 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation53The default  file format \nof GIMP is .xcf. These files are heavy and have  low resolution. There are various other fileformats into which these .xcf files can be exported.JPEG: Acceptedworldwide good quality compressed format.PNG: Good quality bulky format which issupported by all browsers.TIFF: Bulky but good quality formatsupported by all image processing software.It is a good practice to modify your .xcf files and export it to a format like JPEG.\nBy clicking on File  →  \nExport, the ‘Export image JPEG’ window will open. Here the quality of the image can be changed.background. The Clone tool is used to copy from an image or a pattern by using the current brush. It helps in repairing images having problem areas by ‘painting over’ them with pixel data from other areas. This works just like the ‘Format Painter tool’ of a text editor.\nFollow the given steps to use the clone tool.\n1. Insert the image which requires correction.\n2. Select the Tools  Paint Tools  Clone or By \nclicking on the tool icon \n  in Toolbox. Adjust the \nopacity if it is less than 100, to make it look more \nnatural. Adjust the scale and the brush size depending on what you are covering.\n3. Hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard while \ndragging the mouse. If required change the size the clone brush by moving the scale button. If Alignment is set to None, Aligned, or Fixed in tool options, then the point you click on becomes the origin for cloning. The image data at that point will be used when you first begin painting with the Clone tool. In source‑selection mode, the cursor changes to a reticle cross symbol. \n4. You can click on as many areas as you want to \nclone. The Ctrl key is used to select the source, if you are cloning from an image.\nRefer Fig. 3.24 for the final image without text.\nFig. 3.24 Image without unwanted text\nChapter 3.indd   53 27-Feb-19   4:42:11 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nICT T exTbook — Class Ix54Samayra: Now, how do we club all these images together \nin one canvas?\nShirom: That's not a difficult task Samayra. Let me show \nyou how to do that. Refer Fig. 3.25 to club all images together to create a collage.\nFig. 3.25(a): Creating a collage\nChapter 3.indd   54 7/16/2020   2:40:23 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nCreating  Visual Communi Cation55Exercises\n1.
