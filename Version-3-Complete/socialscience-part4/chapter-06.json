Nomads\nare people who do not live in one place but move from one area to\nanother to earn their living. In many parts of India we can see nomadic\npastoralists on the move with their herds of goats and sheep, or\ncamels and cattle. Have you ever wondered where they are coming\nfrom and where they are headed? Do you know how they live and\nearn? What their past has been?\nPastoralists rarely enter the pages of history textbooks. When you\nread about the economy – whether in your classes of history or\neconomics – you learn about agriculture and industry. Sometimes\nyou read about artisans; but rarely about pastoralists. As if their\nlives do not matter. As if they are figures from the past who have no\nplace in modern society.\nIn this chapter you will see how pastoralism has been important in\nsocieties like India and Africa. You will read about the way\ncolonialism impacted their lives, and how they have coped with the\npressures of modern society. The chapter will first focus on India\nand then Africa.\nPastor alists in the Modern W orld\nFig.1 – Sheep grazing on the Bugyals  of eastern Garhwal.\nBugyals are vast natural pastures on the high mountains, above 12,000 feet. They are under snow in the winter and\ncome to life after April. At this time the entire mountainside is covered with a variety of grasses, roots and herbs.\nBy monsoon, these pastures are thick with vegetation and carpeted with wild flowers.\nChapter  V\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n981.1 In the M ountains\nEven today the Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir are great\nherders of goat and sheep. Many of them migrated to this region in\nthe nineteenth century in search of pastures for their animals.\nGradually, over the decades, they established themselves in the area,\nand moved annually between their summer and winter grazing\ngrounds. In winter, when the high mountains were covered with\nsnow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik\nrange. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.\nBy the end of April they began their northern march for their summer\ngrazing grounds. Several households came together for this journey,\nforming what is known as a kafila . They crossed the Pir Panjal passes\nand entered the valley of Kashmir. With the onset of summer, the\nsnow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The variety of\ngrasses that sprouted provided rich nutritious forage for the animal\nherds. By end September the Bakarwals were on the move again, this\ntime on their downward journey, back to their winter base. When\nthe high mountains were covered with snow, the herds were grazed\nin the low hills.\nIn a different area of the mountains, the Gaddi shepherds of\nHimachal Pradesh had a similar cycle of seasonal movement. They\ntoo spent their winter in the low hills of Siwalik range, grazing their\nflocks in scrub forests. By April they moved north and spent the\nsummer in Lahul and Spiti.  When the snow melted and the high\npasses were clear, many of them moved on to higher mountain1 11 11 P P P  P Pastoral astoral astoral astoral astoral N NN NNomads and their omads and their omads and their omads and their omads and their M MM MMovements ovementsovements ovementsovements\nSource A\nWriting in the 1850s, G.C. Barnes gave\nthe following description of the Gujjars\nof Kangra:\n‘In the hills the Gujjars are exclusively\na pastoral tribe – they cultivate scarcely\nat all. The Gaddis keep flocks of sheep\nand goats and the Gujjars, wealth\nconsists of buffaloes. These people live\nin the skirts of the forests, and maintain\ntheir existence exclusively by the sale\nof the milk, ghee, and other produce\nof their herds. The men graze the\ncattle, and frequently lie out for weeks\nin the woods tending their herds. The\nwomen repair to the markets every\nmorning with baskets on their heads,\nwith little earthen pots filled with milk,\nbutter-milk and ghee, each of these\npots containing the proportion required\nfor a day’s meal. During the hot\nweather the Gujjars usually drive their\nherds to the upper range, where the\nbuffaloes rejoice in the rich grass which\nthe rains bring forth and at the same\ntime attain condition from the\ntemperate climate and the immunity\nfrom venomous flies that torment their\nexistence in the plains. ’\nFrom: G.C.

By September they began their return movement. On the\nway they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping\ntheir summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended\nwith their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.\nNext April, once again, they began their march with their goats and\nsheep, to the summer meadows.\nFurther to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders\ncame down to the  dry forests of the bhabar  in the\nwinter, and went up to the high meadows – the\nbugyals  – in summer. Many of them were\noriginally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in\nthe nineteenth century in search of good pastures.\nThis pattern of cyclical movement between summer\nand winter pastures was typical of many pastoral\ncommunities of the Himalayas, including the\nBhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had\nto adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use\nof available pastures in different places. When the\npasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they\nmoved their herds and flock to new areas. This\ncontinuous movement also allowed the pastures to\nrecover; it prevented their overuse.Fig.4 – Gaddi sheep being sheared.\nBy September the Gaddi shepherds come down from the high\nmeadows ( Dhars ).

They were also to be\nfound in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.\nDhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.\nIn the early twentieth century their population in this region was\nestimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were\nblanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar\nshepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the\nmonsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor\nsoil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like\nbajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast\ngrazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars\nharvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march\nof about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing\nagricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds\nwere welcomed by Konkani peasants. After the kharif  harvest was\ncut at this time, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the\nrabi harvest. Dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the\nstubble. The Konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the\nshepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce. With the\nonset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal\nareas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry\nplateau. The sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions.New words\nKharif  – The autumn crop, usually harvested\nbetween September and October\nRabi – The spring crop, usually harvested\nafter March\nStubble – Lower ends of grain stalks left in\nthe ground after harvestingFig.5 – Raika camels grazing\non the Thar desert in western\nRajasthan.\nOnly camels can survive on the\ndry and thorny bushes that can\nbe found here; but to get\nenough feed they have to graze\nover a very extensive area.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n101\nActivitySource BIn Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was\ncovered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep\nherders. The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared\nsheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,\ncultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades\nand took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it\nwas not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of\ntheir movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and\ndry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and\nleft when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet\nconditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Other\nherds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.\nBanjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were\nto be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,\nMadhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland\nfor their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle\nand other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.\nThe accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral\ngroups. In the early nineteenth century , Buchanan visited the\nGollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:\n‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,\nwhere they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their\ncattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy .\nTheir families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in\neach being common. T wo or three of these attend the flocks in\nthe woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supply\nthe towns with firewood, and with str aw for thatch. ’\nFrom:  Francis Hamilton Buchanan, A Journey from Madras through\nthe Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (London, 1807).Read Sources A and B.\n/head2rightWrite briefly about what they tell you about\nthe nature of the work undertaken by men\nand women in pastoral households.\n/head2rightWhy do you think pastoral groups often\nlive on the edges of forests?\nIn the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. The rainfall in\nthe region was meagre and uncertain. On cultivated land,\nharvests fluctuated every year. Over vast stretches no crop\ncould be grown. So the Raikas combined cultivation with\npastoralism. During  the monsoons, the Raikas of  Barmer,\nJaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages,\nwhere pasture was available. By October, when these grazing\ngrounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in search\nof other pasture and water, and returned again during the\nnext monsoon. One group of Raikas – known as the Maru\n(desert) Raikas – herded camels and another group reared\nsheep and goa t.Fig.6 – A camel herder in his settlement.\nThis is on the Thar desert near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.\nThe camel herders of the region are Maru (desert)\nRaikas, and their settlement is called a dhandi .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n102\nSo we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a\ncareful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how\nlong the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could\nfind water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their\nmovements, and ensure that they could move through different\nterritories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the\nway, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the\nsoil. They combined a range of different activities – cultivation, trade,\nand herding – to make their living.\nHow did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?Fig.7 – A camel fair at Balotra in western Rajasthan.  Camel herders come to the fair to sell and buy camels. The Maru\nRaikas also display their expertise in training their camels. Horses from Gujarat are also brought for sale at this fair.\nFig.8 – A camel fair at Pushkar.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n103\nFig.10 – Maldhari herders moving in search of pastures.

Such oral traditions give pastoral groups their own sense of identity.\nThese oral traditions  can tell us about how a group looks at its own past.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n104ActivitySource C Under colonial rule, the life of pastoralists changed dramatically.\nTheir grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated,\nand the revenue they had to pay increased. Their agricultural stock\ndeclined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?\nFirst, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands\ninto cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources\nof its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue\ncollection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,\nwheat and other agricultural produce that were required in\nEngland. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to\nbe unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural\nproduce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought\nunder cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land\nRules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules\nuncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.\nThese individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged\nto settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages\nin the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over\nwere actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So\nexpansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures\nand a problem for pastoralists.\nSecond, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were\nalso being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Acts\nsome forests which produced commercially valuable timber like\ndeodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed\naccess to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.\nIn these, some customary  grazing rights of pastoralists were\ngranted but their movements were severely restricted. The\ncolonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and\nyoung shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The\nherds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.\nThis prevented new trees from growing.\nThese Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were\nnow prevented from entering many forests that had earlier\nprovided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they\nwere allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed\na permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was2\n22 22 Colonial  Colonial  Colonial  Colonial  Colonial R RRRRule and ule and ule and ule and ule and P PP PPastoral astoral astoral astoral astoral L LL LLife ifeife ifeife\nH.S.

Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if\nforage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth\nin the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest\nDepartment permits that had been issued to them now ruled their\nlives. The permit specified the period s in which  they could be\nlegally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.\nThird, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They\ndistrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods\nin villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence\nevery season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.\nThe colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.\nThey wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places\nwith fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easy\nto identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as\npeaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were\nconsidered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in\nIndia passed the Criminal Tribes Act.  By this Act many\ncommunities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified\nas Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature\nand birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were\nexpected to live only in notified village settlements. They were\nnot allowed to move out without a permit. The village police\nkept a continuous watch on them.\nFourth , to expand its revenue income, the colonial government\nlooked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed\non land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on\nanimals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed\non the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was\nintroduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of\ncattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made\nincreasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s\nthe right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These\ncontractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover\nthe money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as\nthey could within the year. By the 1880s the government began\ncollecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was\ngiven a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show\nthe pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and\nthe amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.In the 1920s, a Royal Commission on\nAgriculture reported:\n‘The extent of the area available for\ngrazing has gone down tremendously\nwith the extension of area under\ncultivation because of increasing\npopulation, extension of irrigation\nfacilities, acquiring the pastures for\nGovernment purposes, for example,\ndefence, industries and agricultural\nexperimental farms. [Now] breeders find\nit difficult to raise large herds. Thus their\nearnings have gone down. The quality\nof their livestock has deteriorated,\ndietary standards have fallen and\nindebtedness has increased. ’\nThe Report of the  Royal Commission of\nAgriculture in India, 1928.\nImagine you are living in the 1890s.\nYou belong to a community of nomadic\npastoralist s and craf tsmen.

When grazing\nlands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available\narea of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests\nmeant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture\ntheir cattle in the forests.\nAs pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal\nstock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to\ncontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic\npastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another\narea. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural\nrestoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed\non pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used\nand the quality of patures declined.  This in turn created a further\nshortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.\nUnderfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.\nFig.11 – Pastoralists in India.\nThis map indicates the location of only those\npastoral communities mentioned in the\nchapter. There are many others living in\nvarious parts of India.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n1072.2 How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes?\nPastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some\nreduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not\nenough pasture to feed large numbers. Others  discovered new\npastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.\nAfter 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could\nno longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of\nthe Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries\nbetween India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had\nto find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating\nto Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the\nharvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that\nthe animals provide.\nOver the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and\nsettling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled\npeasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.\nMany poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from\nmoneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep\nand became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.\nYet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions\ntheir numbers have expanded over recent decades. When\npasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the\ndirection of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined\npastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the\nchanges in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry\nregions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the\nmost viable form of life.\nSuch changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities\nin India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement\npatterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did\npastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the\nmodern world?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n108Let us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population\nlives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of\npastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like\nBedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of\nthem now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed\nagriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and\ndonkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also\nearn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity\nwith agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement\ntheir meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.\nLike pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed\ndramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods. What have\nthese changes been?3 3 3 3 3 PPP PPastoralism in Africaastoralism in Africaastoralism in Africaastoralism in Africaastoralism in Africa\nFig.12 – A view of Maasai land with Kilimanjaro in the background.\nForced by changing conditions, the Maasai have grown dependent on food produced in other areas such as maize meal,\nrice, potatoes, cabbage.Traditionally the Maasai frowned upon this. Maasai believed that tilling the land for crop farming is a\ncrime against nature. Once you cultivate the land, it is no longer suitable for grazing. Courtesy: The Massai Association.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n109We will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral\ncommunity – the Maasai – in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders\nlive primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another\n150,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took\naway their land and restricted their movement. This affected their\nlives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.\n3.1 Where have the Grazing Lands Gone?\nOne of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of\ntheir grazing lands. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over\na vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.\nIn the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled\nfor territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different\ncolonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international\nboundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.\nSubsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for\nwhite settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area inFig.13 – Pastoral communities in Africa.\nThe inset shows the location of the Maasais in Kenya and Tanzania.\nOn T anganyika\nBritain conquered what had been German East\nAfrica during the First W orld W ar. In 1919\nTanganyika came under British control. It\nattained independence in 1961 and united with\nZanzibar to form Tanzania in 1964.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n110\nsouth Kenya and north Tanzania. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent\nof their pre-colonial lands. They were confined to an arid zone with\nuncertain rainfall and poor pastures.\nFrom the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government\nin east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand\ncultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into\ncultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had\ndominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and\npolitically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.\nLarge areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like\nthe Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti\nPark in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these\nreserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in\nthese areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that had\ntraditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. The\nSerengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km.\nof Maasai grazing land.\nFig.14  – Without grass, livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) are malnourished, which means less food available for families\nand their children. The areas hardest hit by drought and food shortage  are in the vicinity of Amboseli National Park, which\nlast year generated approximately 240 million Kenyan Shillings (estimated $3.5 million US) from tourism. In addition, the\nKilimanjaro Water Project cuts through the communities of this area but the villagers are barred from using the water for\nirrigation or for livestock.

All this was stopped with\nthe new system of territorial boundaries that restricted\nmovements between regions.\nThe nomadic cattle herders of Kaokoland in Namibia\ncomplained:\n‘We have difficult y. We cry. We are imprisoned. W e do not know\nwhy we are lock ed up . We are in jail. W e have no place to liv e\n… We cannot get meat from the south … Our sleeping skins\ncannot be sent out … Ov amboland is closed for us. W e lived in\nOvamboland for a long time. W e want to tak e our cattle there,\nalso our sheep and goats. The borders are closed. The borders\npress us hea vily. We cannot liv e.’\nStatement of Kaokoland herders, Namibia, 1949.\nQuoted in Michael Bollig, ‘The colonial encapsulation of the north\nwestern Namibian pastor al econom y’, Africa \n68 (4), 1998.Fig.15  – The title Maasai derives from the word Maa. Maa-sai means 'My People'. The Maasai\nare traditionally nomadic and pastoral people who depend on milk and meat for subsistence.\nHigh temperatures combine with low rainfall to create conditions which are dry, dusty, and\nextremely hot.

Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a\ndeterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short\nsupply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.\n3.2 The Borders are Closed\nIn the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast\nareas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one\nplace they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From the\nlate nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing\nvarious restrictions on their mobility.\nLike the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within\nthe confines of special reserves. The boundaries of these reserves\nbecame the limits within which they could now move. They were\nnot allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.\nAnd it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment.\nThose found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished.\nPastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas.\nIn many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any\nform of trade. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists\nas dangerous and savage – people with whom all contact had to be\nminimised. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible,\nbecause white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines\nand, build roads and towns.\nThe new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them\nsuddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. This adversely affectedSource F\nIn most places in colonial Africa, the police were given instructions to keep a\nwatch on the movements of  pastoralists, and prevent them from entering white\nareas. The following is one such instruction given by a magistrate to the police,\nin south-west Africa, restricting the movements of the pastoralists of Kaokoland\nin Namibia:\n‘Passes to enter the T erritory should not be giv en to these Nativ es unless\nexceptional circumstances necessitate their entering … The object of the above\nproclamation is to restrict the number of nativ es entering the T erritory and to\nkeep a check on them, and ordinary visiting passes should therefore never be\nissued to them. ’\n‘Kaokoveld permits to enter ’, Magistr ate to P olice Station Commanders of Outjo\nand K amanjab , 24 No\nvember , 1937.\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n113\nboth their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not\nonly looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The\nrestrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading\nactivities but they were now subject to various restrictions.\n3.3 When P astures Dry\nDrought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail\nand pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be\nmoved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,\npastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This\nnomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.\nBut from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a\nfixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving\nin search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands\nand forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.\nSince they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were\navailable, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease\nin these years of drought. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai\nin Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.\nIn just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the\ncattle in the Maasai Reserve died.\nAs the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts\nincreased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline\nof the animal stock of the pastoralists.\n3.4 Not All were Equally Affected\nIn Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally\naffected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times\nMaasai society was divided into two social categories – elders and\nwarriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic\ncouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.\nThe warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for\nthe protection of the tribe. They defended the community and\norganised cattle raids. Raiding was important in a society where cattle\nwas wealth. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral\ngroups was asserted. Young men came to be recognised as members\nof the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding\nthe cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. They,\nhowever, were subject to the authority of the elders.Fig.16  – Note how the warriors wear\ntraditional deep red shukas, brightly beaded\nMaasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tipped\nspears. Their long pleats of intricately plaited\nhair are tinted red with ochre. As per tradition\nthey face East to honour the rising sun.\nWarriors are in charge of society's security\nwhile boys are responsible for herding\nlivestock. During the drought season, both\nwarriors and boys assume responsibility for\nherding livestock.

They\nappointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were\nmade responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British\nimposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.\nConsequently, the traditional authority of both elders and\nwarriors was adversely affected.\nThe chiefs appointed by the colonial government often\naccumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with\nwhich they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent\nmoney to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many\nof them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.\nTheir wives and children stayed back in the villages to look\nafter the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the\ndevastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and\nnon-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock\nwas depleted.\nBut the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only\non their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have\nthe resources to tide over bad times. In times of war and famine,\nthey lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work\nin the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others\ndid odd jobs. The lucky could get more regular work in road\nor building construction.\nThe social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels.\nFirst, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders\nFig.17  - Even today, young men go through\nan elaborate ritual before they become\nwarriors, although actually it is no longer\ncommon. They must travel throughout the\nsection's region for about four months,\nending with an event where they run to the\nhomestead and enter with an attitude of a\nraider. During the ceremony, boys dress in\nloose clothing and dance non-stop throughout\nthe day. This ceremony is the transition into a\nnew age. Girls are not required to go through\nsuch a ritual.

Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor\npastoralists developed.\nConclusion\nSo we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world\nare affected  in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern\nworld. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their\nmovement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,\npastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture\nlands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that\nremain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of\ndrought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.\nYet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of\ntheir annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights\nto enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for\nrelief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in\nthe management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not\nrelics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the\nmodern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly\ncome to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is\nperfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.\nFig.18 – A Raika shepherd on Jaipur highway.\nHeavy traffic on highways has made migration of shepherds a new experience.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n116Questions\n?Activities\n1.Explain why nomadic tribes need to move from one place to another .\nWhat are the advantages to the environment of this continuous\nmovement?\n2.Discuss why the colonial government in India brought in the following\nlaws.
