In different ways all these events were important in the\nmaking of the modern world.\nChapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,\nfreedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas\nalso have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part\nof that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A\nsociety based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration\nof the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.\nThe idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a\nnew language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central\nideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought\nin many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and\nSouth America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in\na language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.\nIn Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic\nevents that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian\nRevolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of\neconomic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell\nyou about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems\nit faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with\nindustrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens\nthat were essential to the working of a democratic society.

Today\nthe Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth\ncentury it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.\nChapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the\npolitics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,\nabout schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various\nminorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings\nto persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and\nsocialism. But the story of Nazism’s rise is not only about a few specific events,\nabout massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening\nsystem which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the\nideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.\nThe history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom\nand democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n3On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of\nalarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours\nspread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.\nSome 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and\ndecided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of\ngovernment buildings in search of arms.\nFinally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern\npart of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they\nhoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,\nthe commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released –\nthough there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,\nbecause it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was\ndemolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all\nthose who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.\nThe days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the\ncountryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.\nMuch later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as\nthe beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution\nof the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate\nthis outcome. How and why did this happen?The French RevolutionThe French RevolutionThe French RevolutionThe French RevolutionThe French Revolution\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o nFig.1 – Storming of the Bastille .\nSoon after the demolition of the Bastille,\nartists made prints commemorating the event.\nChapter I\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n4In 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the\nthrone of France. He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian\nprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found\nan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis\nXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their\nindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more\nthan a billion livres  to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged\nto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments\nalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining\nan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\nstate was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not\nhave sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided\ninto three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.\nThe society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to\nthe middle a ges. The ter m Old R egime is usuall y used to describe the\nsociety and institutions of France before 1789.\nFig. 2 sho ws ho w the system of  estates in F rench society w as organised.\nPeasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,\nonly a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About\n60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other\nricher members of the third estate. The members of the first two\nestates, that is, the clergy and the nobility , enjoyed cer tain pri vileges by\nbirth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to\nthe sta te. The nob les fur ther enjo yed f eudal pri vileges. These inc luded\nfeudal dues , which they extracted fr om the peasants . Peasants w ere obliged\nto render ser vices to the lor d – to w ork in his house and f ields – to ser ve\nin the ar my or to par ticipa te in b uilding r oads.\nThe Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,\nand f inally,  all member s of the thir d estate had to pa y taxes to the sta te.\nThese included a direct tax, called taille , and a number of indirect taxes\nwhich were levied on ar ticles of  everyday consumption lik e salt or tobacco .\nThe burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne\nby the third estate alone.New words\nLivre – Unit of currency in France,\ndiscontinued in 1794\nClergy – Gr oup of  persons in vested with\nspecial functions in the church\nTithe – A tax levied by the church, comprising\none-tenth of the agricultural produce\nTaille – Tax to be paid directly to the state1  French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century\nClergy\nNobility\nPeasants and\nartisans\nSmall peasants,\nlandless labour ,\nservantsBig businessmen,\nmerchants, court\nofficials, lawyers etc.\nFig.2 – A Society of Estates.\nNote that within the Third Estate some were\nrich and others poor.1st estate\n3rd estate2nd estate\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n5‘This poor fellow brings everything,\ngrain, fruits, money , salad.

This led to a rapid increase in the demand for\nfoodgrains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the\ndemand. So the price of bread which was the staple diet of the majority\nrose rapidly. Most workers were employed as labourers in workshops\nwhose owner fixed their wages. But wages did not keep pace with\nthe rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.\nThings became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.\nThis led to a subsistence crisis , something that occurred frequently\nin France during the Old Regime.\nNew words\nSubsistence crisis – An extreme situation where\nthe basic means of livelihood are endangered\nAnonymous – One whose name remains\nunknown\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n6Activity1.2 How a Subsistence Crisis Happens\nFill in the blank boxes in Fig. 4 with\nappropriate terms from among the following:\nFood riots, scarcity of grain, increased\nnumber of deaths, rising food prices,\nweaker bodies.1.3 A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges\nIn the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against\nincreasing taxes and food scarcity. But they lacked the means and\nprogrammes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about\na change in the social and economic order. This was left to those\ngroups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had\naccess to education and new ideas.\nThe eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,\ntermed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an\nexpanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as\nwoollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the\nricher members of society. In addition to merchants and\nmanufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers\nor administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed\nthat no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a\nperson’s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas\nenvisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and\nopportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John\nLocke and J ean J acques R ousseau.  In his Two Treatises of  Gover nment,\nLocke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute rightFig.4 – The course of a subsistence crisis.The poorest can no\nlonger buy breadBad\nharvest\nDisease\nepidemics\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n7Source A\nAccounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime\n1. Georges Danton , who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in\n1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:\n‘I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of\nimportant men … Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a\npost. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the\narmy was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The\nchurch too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a\nsou. My old friends turned their backs to me … the system had provided us with an\neducation wi thout howev er offering a field wher e our talents could be uti lised.’\n2. An Engl ishman, Arthur Y oung, tr avelled thr ough Fr ance during the y ears f rom 1787 to\n1789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what he\nsaw.\n‘He who decides to be served and waited upon by slaves, ill-treated slaves at that, must\nbe fully aware that by doing so he is placing his property and his life in a situation which is\nvery different from that he would be in, had he chosen the services of free and well-\ntreated men. And he who chooses to dine to the accompaniment of his victims’ groans,\nshould not complain i f during a riot his daughter gets kidnapped or his son’ s throat is sl it.’\nWhat message is Young trying to convey here? Whom does he mean when he speaks of‘ ‘slaves’?\nWho is he criticising? What dangers does he sense in the situation of 1787?Activityof the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a\nform of government based on a social contract between people\nand their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws,  Montesquieu\nproposed a division of power within the government between\nthe legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of\ngovernment was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen\ncolonies declared their independence from Britain. The American\nconstitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important\nexample for political thinkers in France.\nThe ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons\nand coffee-houses and spread among people through books and\nnewspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the\nbenefit of those who could not read and write. The news that\nLouis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the\nexpenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system\nof privileges.\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n8Louis XVI had to increase taxes for reasons you have learnt in the\nprevious section. How do you think he could have gone about doing\nthis? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the\npower to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to\ncall a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his\nproposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to\nwhich the three estates sent their representatives. However, the\nmonarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The\nlast time it was done was in 1614.\nOn 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates\nGeneral to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in\nVersailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second\nestates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing\neach other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate\nhad to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more\nprosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women\nwere denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and\ndemands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives\nhad brought with them.\nVoting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according\nto the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis\nXVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of\nthe third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the\nassembly as a  whole, where each member would have one vote. This\nwas one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers\nlike Rousseau in his book The Social Contract . When the king rejected\nthis proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly\nin protest.\nThe representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen\nfor the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall\nof an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared\nthemselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they\nhad drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of\nthe monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeau\nwas born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away\nwith a society of feudal privilege. He brought out a journal and\ndelivered powerful speeches to the crowds assembled at Versailles.2  The Outbreak of the Revolution\nActivity\nRepresentatives of the Third Estate take the\noath raising their arms in the direction of\nBailly , the President of the Assembly ,\nstanding on a table in the centre.

A severe winter\nhad meant a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers exploited\nthe situation and hoarded supplies. After spending hours in long\nqueues at the bakery, crowds of angry women stormed into the\nshops. At the same time, the king ordered troops to move into Paris.\nOn 14 July, the agitated crowd stormed and destroyed the Bastille.\nIn the countryside rumours spread from village to village that the\nlords of the manor  had hired bands of brigands who were on their\nway to destroy the ripe crops. Caught in a frenzy of fear, peasants in\nseveral districts seized hoes and pitchforks and attacked chateaux .\nThey looted hoarded grain and burnt down documents containing\nrecords of manorial dues. A large number of nobles fled from their\nhomes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.\nFaced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally\naccorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the\nprinciple that his powers would from now on be checked by a\nconstitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed a\ndecree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members\nof the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges. Tithes were\nabolished and lands owned by the Church were confiscated. As a\nresult, the government acquired assets worth at least 2 billion livres.\nNew words\nChateau (pl. chateaux)  – Castle or stately\nresidence belonging to a king or a nobleman\nManor – An estate consisting of the lord’s\nlands and his mansionFig.5 – The Tennis Court Oath.\nPreparatory sketch for a large painting by Jacques-Louis David.

Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These\npowers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,\nwere now separated and assigned to different institutions – the\nlegislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional\nmonarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.\nThe Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the\nNational Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens\nvoted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not\nall citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years\nof age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage\nwere given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to\nvote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive\ncitizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,\na man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.Fig.7 – The Political sytstem under the Constitution of 1791.\nJudiciary Executive Legislature\nJudge King National Assembly  (745 members)\nElectors (50,000 men) Ministers\nActive citizens: entitled to vote.

Rights such as the right to life, freedom of speech,\nfreedom of opinion, equality before law, were established as ‘natural\nand inalienable’ rights, that is, they belonged to each human being\nby birth and could not be taken away. It was the duty of the state to\nprotect each citizen’s natural rights.\nThe revolutionary journalist Jean-Paul\nMarat commented in his newspaper\nL’Ami du peuple  (The f riend of the\npeople) on the Constitution drafted by\nthe National Assembly:\n‘The task of representing the people\nhas been given to the rich … the lot of\nthe poor and oppressed will never be\nimproved by peaceful means alone.

Rulers of other neighbouring\ncountries too were worried by the developments in France and made\nplans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place\nthere since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National\nAssembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.\nThousands of  volunteer s thronged from the pr ovinces to join the ar m\ny.\nThey saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all\nover Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise ,\ncomposed by the poet Roget de L’Isle. It was sung for the first time by\nvolunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its\nname. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.\nThe revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties\nto the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,\nwomen were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and\nlooking after their families. Large sections of the population were\nconvinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the\nConstitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections\nof society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for\npeople who wished to discuss government policies and plan their\nown forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of\nthe Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent  of St\nJacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this\nperiod, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell\nyou more about their activities and demands.\nThe members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less\nprosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,\nartisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,\nas well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was\nMaximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided\nto start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by\ndock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable\nsections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches.

These Jacobins came to be known as the\nsans-culottes, literally meaning ‘those without knee breeches’. Sans-\nculottes men wore in addition the red cap that symbolised liberty.\nWomen however were not allowed to do so.\nIn the summer of 1792 the Jacobins planned an insurrection of a\nlarge number of Parisians who were angered by the short supplies\nand high prices of food. On the morning of August 10 they stormed\nthe Palace of the Tuileries, massacred the king’s guards and held\nthe king himself as hostage for several hours.

Has\nanyone heard of something more senseless?\nWould it be possible to bring a single person\nto the scaffold without making ten more\nenemies among his relations and friends?’\nOn 7 February 1794,\nRobespierre made a\nspeech at the\nConvention, which was\nthen carried by the\nnewspaper Le  Moniteur\nUniversel . Here is an\nextract from it:\n‘To establ ish and consol idate democr acy, to\nachieve the peaceful rule of constitutional\nlaws, we must first finish the war of liberty\nagainst tyranny …. We must annihilate the\nenemies of the republic at home and abroad,\nor else we shall perish.

The queen Marie Antoinette met with the\nsame fate shortly after.\n3.1 The Reign of Terror\nThe period from 1793 to 1794 is referred to as the Reign of\nTerror. Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and\npunishment. All those whom he saw as being ‘enemies’ of the\nrepublic – ex-nobles and clergy, members of other political\nparties, even members of his own party who did not agree with\nhis methods – were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a\nrevolutionary tribunal. If the court found them ‘guilty’ they\nwere guillotined. The guillotine is a device consisting of two\npoles and a blade with which a person is beheaded. It was named\nafter Dr Guillotin who invented it.\nRobespierre’s government issued laws placing a maximum ceiling\non wages and prices. Meat and bread were rationed. Peasants\nwere forced to transport their grain to the cities and sell it at\nprices fixed by the government. The use of more expensive white\nflour was forbidden; all citizens were required to eat the pain\nd’égalité  (equality bread), a loaf made of wholewheat. Equality\nwas also sought to be practised through forms of speech and\naddress. Instead of the traditional Monsieur (Sir) and Madame\n(Madam) all French men and women were henceforth Citoyen\nand Citoyenne (Citizen). Churches were shut down and their\nbuildings converted into barracks or offices.\nRobespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his\nsupporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was\nconvicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and on the next day\nsent to the guillotine.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n17Fig.11  – The revolutionary government sought to mobilise the loyalty of its subjects through various means – one of\nthem was the staging of festivals like this one.

A new constitution was introduced which\ndenied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided\nfor two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,\nan executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard\nagainst the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under\nthe Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative\ncouncils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability\nof the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,\nNapoleon Bonaparte.\nThrough all these changes in the form of government, the ideals of\nfreedom, of equality before the law and of fraternity remained inspiring\nideals that motivated political movements in France and the rest of Europe\nduring the f ollowing centur y.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n184 44 44     Did Women have a Revolution?Did Women have a Revolution?Did Women have a Revolution?Did Women have a Revolution?Did Women have a Revolution?\nFig.12  – Parisian women on their way to Versailles.\nThis print is one of the many pictorial representations of the events of 5 October 1789, when women marched to Versailles\nand brought the king back with them to Paris.\nFrom the very beginning women were active participants in the events\nwhich brought about so many important changes in French society.\nThey hoped that their involvement would pressurise the revolutionary\ngovernment to introduce measures to improve their lives. Most\nwomen of the third estate had to work for a living. They worked as\nseamstresses or laundresses, sold flowers, fruits and vegetables at the\nmarket, or were employed as domestic servants in the houses of\nprosperous people. Most women did not have access to education or\njob training. Only daughters of nobles or wealthier members of the\nthird estate could study at a convent, after which their families\narranged a marriage for them. Working women had also to care for\ntheir families, that is, cook, fetch water, queue up for bread and\nlook after the children. Their wages were lower than those of men.\nIn order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own\npolitical clubs and newspapers. About sixty women’s clubs came up\nin different French cities. The Society of Revolutionary and\nRepublican Women was the most famous of them.

Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced\nthem to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be\nelected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they\nfelt, would their interests be represented in the new government.\nIn the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws\nthat helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation\nof state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their\nfathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.\nMarriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered\nunder civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by\nboth women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could\nbecome artists or run small businesses.\nWomen’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering\nclosure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities. Many\nprominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.\nWomen’s movements for voting rights and equal wages continued\nthrough the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.\nThe fight for the vote was carried out through an international\nsuffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. The example of the political activities of French women\nduring the revolutionary years was kept alive as an inspiring memory.\nIt was finally in 1946 that women in France won the right to vote.\nThe life of a revolutionary woman – Olympe de Gouges\n(1748-1793)\nOlympe de Gouges was one of the most important of the politically\nactive women in revolutionary France. She protested against the\nConstitution and the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen as\nthey excluded women from basic rights that each human being was\nentitled to. So , in 1791 , she wrote a Declaration of the Rights of\nWoman and Citizen, which she addressed to the Queen and to the\nmembers of the National Assembly , demanding that they act upon\nit. In 1793 , Olympe de Gouges criti cised the Jacobin government\nfor forcibly closing down women’s clubs. She was tried by the\nNational Convention, which charged her with treason. Soon after\nthis she was executed .Source E\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n20ActivitySource F\nSome of the basic rights set forth in Olympe de Gouges’\nDeclaration .\n1.Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights.\n2.The goal of all political associations is the preservation of the natural\nrights of woman and man: These rights ar e liberty, property , securi ty,\nand above all resistance to oppression.\n3.The source of all sovereignty resides in the nation, which is nothing\nbut the union of woman and man.\n4.The law should be the expression of the general will; all female and\nmale citizens should have a say either personally or by their\nrepresentatives in its formulation; it should be the same for all. All\nfemale and male citizens are equally entitled to all honours\nand public employment according to their abilities and without any\nother distinction than that of their talents.\n5.No woman is an exception; she is accused, arrested, and detained in\ncases determined by law. Women, like men, obey this rigorous law.Compare the manifesto drafted by Olympe de\nGouges (Source F) with the Declaration of the\nRights of Man and Citizen (Source C).\nIn 1793, the Jacobin politician Chaumette\nsought to justify the closure of women’s\nclubs on the following grounds:\n‘Has Nature entrusted domestic duties to\nmen? Has she given us breasts to nurture\nbabies?\nNo.\nShe said to Man:\nBe a man. Hunting, agriculture, political duties\n… that is your kingdom.\nShe said to Woman:\nBe a woman … the things of the household,\nthe sweet duties of motherhood – those\nare your tasks.\nShameless are those women, who wish to\nbecome men.

The colonies in\nthe Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were\nimportant suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar\nand coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant\nand unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.\nSo this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa\nand the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.\nFrench merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to\nthe African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.\nBranded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for\nthe three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.\nThere they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave\nlabour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European\nmarkets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and\nNantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery\nin France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether\nthe rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including\nthose in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition\nfrom businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It\nwas finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves\nin the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be\na short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.\nPlantation owners understood their freedom as including the right\nto enslave African Negroes  in pursuit of their economic interests.\nSlavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.Fig.14 – The emancipation of slaves.\nThis print of 1794 describes the emancipation\nof slaves. The tricolour banner on top carries\nthe slogan: ‘The rights of man’. The\ninscription below reads: ‘The freedom of the\nunfree’.

The years following 1789 in France saw many\nsuch changes in the lives of men, women and children.

Now the Dec laration\nof the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and\nexpression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and\nprinted pictures flooded the towns of France from where they\ntravelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed\nthe events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press\nalso meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each\nside sought to convince the others of its position through the medium\nof print. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers\nof people. This was one way they could grasp and identify with ideas\nsuch as liberty or justice that political philosophers wrote about at\nlength in texts which only a handful of educated people could read.Describe the picture in your own words.
