His father, a prominent physician,\ndeliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire\nfamily, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about\nhis fear of revenge, saying, ‘Now the Allies  will do to us what we did to\nthe crippled and Jews.’ The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,\nwhere they spent their last happy time together, singing old children’s\nsongs. Later, Helmuth’s father shot himself in his office. Helmuth\nremembers that he saw his father’s bloody uniform being burnt in the\nfamily fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and\nwhat had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the\nfollowing nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.\nAlthough Helmuth may not have realised all that it meant, his father\nhad been a Nazi and a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Many of you will\nknow something about the Nazis and Hitler. You probably know\nof Hitler’s determination to make Germany into a mighty power\nand his ambition of conquering all of Europe. You may have heard\nthat he killed Jews. But Nazism was not one or two isolated acts. It\nwas a system, a structure of ideas about the world and politics. Let\nus try and understand what Nazism was all about. Let us see why\nHelmuth’s father killed himself and what the basis of his fear was.\nIn May 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allies. Anticipating what\nwas coming, Hitler, his propaganda minister Goebbels and his entire\nfamily committed suicide collectively in his Berlin bunker in April.\nAt the end of the war, an International Military Tribunal at\nNuremberg was set up to prosecute Nazi war criminals for Crimes\nagainst Peace, for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.\nGermany’s conduct during the war, especially those actions whichNazism and the RiseNazism and the RiseNazism and the RiseNazism and the RiseNazism and the Rise\nof Hitlerof Hitlerof Hitlerof Hitlerof Hitler\nNazism and the Ri se of Hitler\nFig.1 – Hitler (centre) and Goebbels (left)\nleaving after an official meeting, 1932.New words\nAllies – The Allied Powers were initially led by the UK and France.\nIn 1941 they were joined by the USSR and USA.

What\nwere these acts?\nUnder the shadow of the Second World War, Germany had waged\na genocidal war, which resulted in the mass murder of selected\ngroups of innocent civilians of Europe. The number of people killed\nincluded 6 million Jews, 200,000 Gypsies, 1 million Polish civilians,\n70,000 Germans who were considered mentally and physically\ndisabled, besides innumerable political opponents. Nazis devised\nan unprecedented  means of killing people, that is, by  gassing them in\nvarious killing centres  like Auschwitz. The Nuremberg Tribunal\nsentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were\nimprisoned for life. The retribution did come, yet the punishment\nof the Nazis was far short of the brutality and extent of their crimes.\nThe Allies did not want to be as harsh on defeated Germany as\nthey had been after the First World War.\nEveryone came to feel that the rise of Nazi Germany could be\npartly traced back to the German experience at the end of  the\nFirst World War.\nWhat was this experinece?New words\nGenocidal – Killing on large scale leading\nto destruction of large sections of people\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n51Germany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth\ncentury,  fought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the\nAustrian empire  and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)\nAll joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick\nvictory. Little did they realise that the war would stretch on,\neventually draining Europe of all its resources. Germany made initial\ngains by occupying France and Belgium.

Deputies were now elected to\nthe German Parliament or Reichstag, on the basis of equal and\nuniversal votes cast by all adults including women.\nThis republic, however, was not received well by its own people\nlargely because of the terms it was forced to accept after Germany’s\ndefeat at the end of the First  World War.

From a continent of creditors,\nEurope turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar\nRepublic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The\nrepublic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation\nand was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.\nThose w ho suppor ted the Weimar R epublic, mainl y Socialists , Catholics\nand Democr ats, became easy tar gets of  attack in the conser vative\nnationalist cir cles.\n They were moc kingly called the ‘November criminals’.\nThis mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the\nearly 1930s, as we will soon see.\nThe First World War left a deep imprint on European society and\npolity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and\npublicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong\nand masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,\nwas that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with\nrats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,\nand witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda\nand national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while\npopular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently\ncome into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,\nwhich could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.\n1.2 Political Radicalism and Economic Crises\nThe birth of the Weimar Republic coincided with the revolutionary\nuprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik\nRevolution in Russia. Soviets of workers and sailors were establishedVersailles with the Allies w as a har sh and humilia ting peace . Germany lost\nits overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, 13 per cent of its territories,\n75 per cent of  its ir on and 26 per cent of  its coal to F rance, Poland,\nDenmar k and Lithuania.

The political atmosphere in Berlin was charged with\ndemands for Soviet-style governance. Those opposed to this – such\nas the socialists, Democrats and Catholics – met in Weimar to give\nshape to the democratic republic. The Weimar Republic crushed the\nuprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free\nCorps. The anguished Spar tacists la ter founded the Comm unist P arty of\nGermany\n. Comm unists and Socialists hencef orth became ir reconcila ble\nenemies and could not mak e common cause a gainst Hitler . Both\nrevolutionaries and militant na tionalists cr aved for radical solutions .\nPolitical radicalisation was only heightened by the economic crisis\nof 1923. Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to\npay war reparations  in gold. This depleted  gold reserves at a time\nresources were scarce. In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the\nFrench occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal.\nGermany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency\nrecklessly. With too much  printed money in circulation, the value\nof the German mark fell. In April the US dollar was equal to 24,000\nmarks, in July 353,000 marks, in August 4,621,000 marks  and  at\nFig.3 – This is a rally organised by the radical group known as the Spartacist League.\nIn the winter of 1918-1919 the streets of Berlin were taken over by the people. Political demonstrations became common.\nFig.4 – Baskets and carts being loaded at a\nbank in Berlin with paper currency for wage\npayment, 1923. The German mark had so\nlittle value that vast amounts had to be used\neven for small payments.New words\nDeplete – Reduce, empty out\nReparation – Make up for a wrong done\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n5498,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As\nthe value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of\nGermans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread\nwas widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came\nto be known as hyperinflation , a situation  when prices rise\nphenomenally high.\nEventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of\nthe crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms\nof reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.\n1.3 The Y ears of Depression\nThe years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. Yet this was\nbuilt on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were\ntotally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This\nsupport was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange  crashed in\n1929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their\nshares. On one single day, 24 October, 13 million shares were sold.\nThis was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next\nthree years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA\nfell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit\nand speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects\nof this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.\nThe German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By\n1932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the 1929\nlevel. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number\nof unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets\nof Germany you could see men with placards around their necks\nsaying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Unemployed youths played cards\nor simply sat at street corners, or desperately queued up at the local\nemployment exchange. As jobs disappeared, the youth took to\ncriminal activities and total despair became  commonplace.\nThe economic crisis created deep anxieties and fears in people. The\nmiddle classes, especially salaried employee s and pensioners, saw\ntheir savings diminish when the currency lost its value. Small\nbusinessmen, the self -employed and retailers suffered as their\nFig.5 – Homeless men queuing up for a\nnight’s shelter, 1923.\nFig.6  – Sleeping on the line.

These sections of society were filled with the\nfear of proletarianisation , an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks\nof the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised\nworkers could manage to keep their heads above water, but\nunemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was\nin crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in\nagricultural prices  and women, unable to fill their children’s\nstomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.\nPolitically  too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar\nconstitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable\nand vulnerable to dictatorship. One was proportional\nrepresentation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a\nnear impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect\nwas Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose\nemergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short\nlife, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on\nan average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis\ncould not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic\nparliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.\nNew words\nProletarianisation – To become impoverished to the level of\nworking classes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n56This crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background\nto Hitler’s rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his\nyouth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled\nfor the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and\nearned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the\nVersailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group\ncalled the German Workers’ Party. He subsequently took over the\norganisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’\nParty. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.\nIn 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin\nand capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and\nlater released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular\nsupport till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that\nNazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, banks\ncollapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the\nmiddle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation\nNazi propaganda  stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi\nParty got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag – the\nGerman parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with\n37 per cent votes.2  Hitler’ s Rise to P ower\nFig.7 – Hitler being greeted at the Party Congress in Nuremberg in 1938 .New words\nPropaganda – Specific type of message\ndirectly aimed at influencing the opinion\nof people (through the use of posters, films,\nspeeches, etc.)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n57\nHitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved\npeople. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of\nthe Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.\nHe promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure\nfuture for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences\nand resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.\nHitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance\nof rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies\nand public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil\na sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the\nSwastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after\nthe speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.Fig.9 — Hitler addressing SA and SS columns.\nNotice the sweeping and straight columns of\npeople. Such photographs were intended to\nshow the grandeur and power of the Nazi\nmovementFig.8 – Nuremberg Rally, 1936.\nRallies like this were held every year. An\nimportant aspect of these was the\ndemonstration of Nazi power as various\norganisations paraded past Hitler, swore\nloyalty and listened to his speeches.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n58Nazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as\nsomeone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is\nan image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of\ndignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time\nof acute economic and political crises.\n2.1 The Destruction of Democracy\nOn 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the\nChancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to\nHitler. By now the Nazis had  managed to rally the conservatives to\ntheir cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the\nstructures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in\nthe German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.\nThe Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic\nrights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been\nguaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his arch-\nenemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off\nto the newly established concentration camps . The repression of\nthe Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files\nof Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were\nthose of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among\nthe 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.\nOn 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act\nestablished dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to\nsideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade\nunions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The\nstate established complete control over the economy, media, army\nand judiciary.\nSpecial surveillance and security forces were created to control and\norder society in ways that the Nazis wanted.  Apart from the already\nexisting regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm\nTroopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the\nprotection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It\nwas the extra-constitutional powers of these newly organised forces\nthat gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal\nstate. People could now be detained in Gestapo torture chambers,\nrounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or\narrested without any legal procedures. The police forces acquired\npowers to rule with impunity.New words\nConcentration camp – A camp where people\nwere isolated and detained without due\nprocess of law. Typically, it was surrounded\nby electrified barbed wire fences.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n592.2 Reconstruction\nHitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the\neconomist Hjalmar Schacht who aimed at full production and full\nemployment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This\nproject produced the famous German superhighways and the\npeople’s car, the Volkswagen.\nIn foreign policy also Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled\nout of the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in\n1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan,\nOne people, One empire, and One leader . He then went on to wrest German-\nspeaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia, and gobbled up the\nentire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of\nEngland, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh.\nThese quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the\ndestiny of the country.\nHitler did not stop here. Schacht had advised Hitler against investing\nhugely in rearmament as the state still ran on deficit financing.\nCautious people, however, had no place in Nazi Germany. Schacht\nhad to leave. Hitler chose war as the way out of the approaching\nFig.10 – The poster announces: ‘Your\nvolkswagen’.\nSuch posters suggested that owning a car was\nno longer just a dream for an ordinary worker.\nFig.11 – Expansion of Nazi power: Europe 1942.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n60\neconomic crisis.  Resources were to be accumulated through\nexpansion of territory.  In September 1939, Germany invaded\nPoland. This started a war with France and England. In September\n1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and\nJapan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to international power. Puppet\nregimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large\npart of Europe. By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of\nhis power.\nHitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering\nEastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space\nfor Germans.  He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this\nhistoric blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British\naerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.\nThe Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat\non Germany at Stalingrad.  After this the Soviet Red Army\nhounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the\nheart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern\nEurope for half a century thereafter.\nMeanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was\nunwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the\nFirst World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war\nfor long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied\nFrench Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in\nthe Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed\nthe US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World\nWar. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitler’s defeat and the US\ndropping of the atom bomb  on Hiroshima in Japan.\nFrom this brief account of what happened in the Second World\nWar, we now return to Helmuth and his father’s story, a story of\nNazi criminality during the war.\nFig.12 – Newspapers in India track the\ndevelopments in Germany.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n61ActivityThe crimes that Nazis committed were linked to a system of belief\nand a set of practices.\nNazi ideology was synonymous with Hitler’s worldview. According\nto this there was no equality between people, but only a racial\nhierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans\nwere at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They\ncame to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.\nAll other coloured people were placed in between depending upon\ntheir external features. Hitler’s racism borrowed from thinkers like\nCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist\nwho tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the\nconcept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later\nadded the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only\nthose species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to\nchanging climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin\nnever advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely\nnatural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist\nthinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered\npeoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would\nsurvive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the\nfinest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the\nworld.\nThe other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical\nconcept of Lebensraum , or living space. He believed that new territories\nhad to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of\nthe mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain\nan intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance\nthe material resources and power of the German nation.\nHitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,\nto concentrate all Germans geographically in one place. Poland became\nthe laboratory for this experimentation.\n3.1 Establishment of the Racial State\nOnce in power, the Nazis quickly began to implement their dream\nof creating an exclusive racial community of pure Germans by\nphysically eliminating all those who were seen as  ‘undesirable’ in the3  The Nazi Worldview\nSource A\n‘For this earth is not allotted to anyone\nnor is it presented to anyone as a gift.

Nazis wanted only a society of ‘pure and healthy\nNordic Aryans’. They alone were considered ‘desirable’. Only they\nwere seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others\nwho were classed as ‘undesirable’. This meant that even those Germans\nwho were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under\nthe Euthanasia Programme, Helmuth’s father along with other Nazi\nofficials had condemned to death many Germans who were considered\nmentally or physically unfit.\nJews were not the only community classified as ‘undesirable’. There\nwere others. Many Gypsies  and blacks living in Nazi Germany were\nconsidered as racial ‘inferiors’ who threatened the biological purity\nof the ‘superior Aryan’ race. They were widely persecuted . Even\nRussians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving\nof any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of\nRussia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many\nof them died simply through hard work and starvation.\nJews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred  of\nJews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards\nJews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and\nusurers .Until medieval times  Jews were barred from owning land.\nThey survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived\nin separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted\nthrough periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.\nHowever, Hitler’s hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific\ntheories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to\n‘the Jewish problem’. It could be solved only through their\ntotal elimination.\nFrom 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised  and segregated\nthe Jews, compelling them to leave the country. The next phase,\n1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually\nkilling them in gas chambers in Poland.\n3.2 The Racial Utopia\nUnder the shadow of war , the Nazis proceeded  to realise their\nmurderous, racial ideal. Genocide and war became two side s of the\nsame coin. Occupied Poland was divided up . Much of north-western\nPoland was annexed to Germany. Poles were forced to leave their\nhomes and properties behind to be occupied by ethnic Germans\nbrought in from occupied Europe.

He felt\nthat a strong Nazi society could be established only by teaching children\nNazi ideology. This required a control over the child both inside and\noutside school.\nWhat happened in schools under Nazism? All schools were ‘cleansed ’\nand ‘purified\n’. This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as\n‘politically unreliable’ were dismissed. Children were first segregated:\nGermans and Jews could not sit together or play together.\nSubsequently, ‘undesirable children’ – Jews,  the physically handicapped,\nGypsies – were thrown out of schools. And finally in the 1940s, they\nwere taken to the gas chambers.\n‘Good German’ children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling,\na prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks were\nrewritten. Racial science was introduced to justify Nazi ideas of race.\nStereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes.\nChildren were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worship\nHitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a spirit of violence\nand aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could make\nchildren iron hearted, strong and masculine.\nYouth organisations were made responsible for educating German\nyouth in the ‘the spirit of National Socialism’. Ten-year-olds had to\nenter Jungvolk .  At 14, all boys had to join the Nazi youth organi sation\n– Hitler Youth – where they learnt to worship war, glorify aggression\nand violence, condemn democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies\nand all those categorised as ‘undesirable’. After a period of rigorous\nideological and physical training they joined the Labour Service, usually\nat the age of 18. Then they had to serve in the armed forces and enter\none of the Nazi organisations.\nThe Youth League of the Nazis was founded in 1922. Four years later\nit was renamed Hitler Youth. To unify the youth movement under\nNazi control, all other youth organisations were systematically dissolved\nand finally banned.4  Youth in Nazi Germany\nIf you were a student sitting in one of these\nclasses, how would you have felt towards\nJews?\nHave you ever thought of the stereotypes of\nother communities that people around you\nbelieve in?

The fight for equal rights for men\nand women that had become part of democratic struggles everywhere\nwas wrong  and it would destroy society. While boys were taught\nto be aggressive, masculine and steel hearted, girls were told that\nthey had to become good mothers and rear pure -blooded Aryan\nchildren. Girls  had to maintain the purity of the race, distanceSource: D\nRobert La y, head of the German Labour Front, said:\n‘We start when the child is three y ears old. As soon as he ev en\nstarts to think, he is given a little flag to wave. Then comes\nschool, the Hitler Y outh, military service. But when all this is\nover, we don’ t let go of an yone.

W e consider it\nnatural that these two worlds remain\ndistinct…What the man gives in courage\non the battlefield, the woman gives in\neternal self-sacrifice, in eternal pain and\nsuffering. Every child that women bring\nto the world is a battle, a battle waged\nfor the existence of her people.Source Ethemselves from Jews, look after the home, and teach their\nchildren Nazi values. They had to be the bearers of the Aryan\nculture and race.\nIn 1933 Hitler said: ‘In my state the mother is the most important\ncitizen.’ But in Nazi Germany all mothers were not treated equally.\nWomen who bore racially undesirable children were punished\nand those who produced racially desirable children were awarded.\nThey were given favoured treatment in hospitals and were also\nentitled to concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway\nfares. To encourage women to produce many children, Honour\nCrosses were awarded. A bronze cross was given for four children,\nsilver for six and gold for eight or more.\nAll ‘Aryan’ women who deviated from the prescribed code of\nconduct were publicly condemned, and severely punished. Those\nwho maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were\nparaded through the town with shaved heads, blackened faces and\nplacards hanging around their necks announcing ‘I have sullied\nthe honour of the nation’. Many received jail sentences and lost\ncivic honour as well as their husbands and families for this\n‘criminal offence ’.\n4.2. The Art of Propaganda\nThe Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to\ngreat effect. The terms they coined to describe their various\npractices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never\nused the words ‘kill’ or ‘murder’ in their official communications.\nMass killings were termed special treatment, final solution  (for the Jews),\neuthanasia  (for the disabled), selection  and disinfections\n. ‘Evacuation’\nmeant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the\ngas chambers were called? They were labelled ‘disinfection-areas’,\nand looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.\nMedia was carefully used to win support for the regime and\npopularise its worldview. Nazi ideas were spread th rough visual\nimages, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters,\ngroups identified as the ‘enemies’ of Germans were stereotyped,\nmocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were\nrepresented as weak and degenerate. They were attacked as\nmalicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create\nhatred for Jews. The most inf amous f ilm w as The Eter nal J ew.\nOrthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked.

They were\nreferred to as vermin, rats and pests. Their movements were compared\nto those of rodents. Nazism worked on the minds of the people,\ntapped their emotions, and turned their hatred and anger at those\nmarked as ‘undesirable’.\nThe Nazis made equal efforts to appeal to all the different sections of\nthe population. They sought to win their support by suggesting that\nNazis alone could solve all their problems.How would you have reacted to Hilter’s ideas\nif you were:\n/head2rightA Jewish woman\n/head2rightA non-Jewish German womanSource F\nHitler at the  Nuremberg P arty Rally, 8 September 1934, also\nsaid:\n‘The woman is the most stable element in the preservation\nof a folk…she has the most unerring sense of everything that\nis important to not let a race disappear because it is her\nchildren who would be affected by all this suffering in the\nfirst place…That is why we have integrated the woman in\nthe struggle of the racial community just as nature and\nprovidence ha ve determined so .’\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n70GERMAN FARMER\nYOU BELONG TO HITLER!\nWHY?\nThe German farmer stands in between two great dangers\ntoday:\nThe one danger American economic system –\nBig Capitalism!\nThe other is the Marxist economic system of Bolshevism.\nBig Capitalism and Bolshevism work hand in hand:\nthey are born of Jewish thought\nand serve the master plan of world Jewery.\nWho alone can rescue the farmer from these dangers?\nNATIONAL SOCIALISM .\nFrom:  a Nazi leaflet, 1932.\nActivity\nLook at Figs. 29 and 30 and answer the following:\nWhat do they tell us about Nazi propaganda?

They felt hatred and anger surge inside them when\nthey saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses\nof Jews and reported suspicious neighbours. They genuinely believed\nNazism would bring prosperity  and improve general well-being.\nBut not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active resistance\nto Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority\nof Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.\nThey were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to\nlook  away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an\nabsence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans\nin the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people\nin the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:\n‘First they came for the Communists,\nWell, I was not a Communist –\nSo I said nothing.\nThen they came for the Social Democrats,\nWell, I was not a Social Democrat\nSo I did nothing,\nThen they came for the trade unionists,\nBut I was not a trade unionist.\nAnd then they came for the Jews,\nBut I was not a Jew – so I did little.\nThen when they came for me,\nThere was no one left who could stand up for me. ’Was the lack of concern for Nazi victims only\nbecause of the \nTerror? No, says Lawrence\nRees who interviewed people from diverse\nbackgrounds for his recent document ary,\n‘The Nazis: A Warning from History’.\nErna Kranz, an ordinary German teenager in\nthe1930s and a grandmother now ,  said to\nRees:\n‘1930s offered a glimmer of hope, not just for\nthe unemployed but for everybody for we all\nfelt downtrodden. From my own experience I\ncould say salaries increased and Germany\nseemed to have regained its sense of\npurpose. I could only say for myself, I thought\nit was a good time. I liked it.’5  Ordinary P eople and the Crimes Against Humanity\nActivity\nWhy does Erna Kranz say , ‘I could only say for myself ’? How do you\nview her opinion?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n72What Jews felt in Nazi Germany is a different story altogether.\nCharlotte Beradt secretly recorded people’s dreams in her diary and\nlater published them in a highly disconcerting book called the Third\nReich of Dreams . She describes how Jews themselves began believing in\nthe Nazi stereotypes about them. They dreamt of their hooked noses,\nblack hair and eyes, Jewish looks and body movements. The\nstereotypical images publicised in the Nazi press haunted the Jews.\nThey troubled them even in their dreams. Jews died many deaths\neven before they reached the gas chamber.\n5.1 Knowledge about the Holocaust\nInformation about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany\nduring the last years of the regime. But it was only after the war\nended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise the\nhorrors of what had ha ppened.  While the Ger mans w ere preoccupied\nwith their own plight as a defeated nation emerging out of the rubble,\nthe Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings\nthey had endured during the Nazi killing operations – also called the\nHolocaust . At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that\nhe wanted to outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he\nmeant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had\nhappened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness\nand to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp\ninhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.\nOn the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership\ndistributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating\nevidence available in offices.\nYet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs,\nfiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many\nparts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted it,\nan embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning\nto those who watched in silence.Fig.31  – Inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto\ncollected documents and placed them in three\nmilk cans along with other containers. As\ndestruction seemed imminent, these containers\nwere buried in the cellars of buildings in 1943.\nThis can was discovered in 1950.\nFig.32  – Denmark secretly rescued their Jews\nfrom Germany.
