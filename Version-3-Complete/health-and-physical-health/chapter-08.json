Sports play a significant role in healthy social development and interaction. It helps people learn how to set and achieve goals through discipline and hard work. It nurtures the development of decision-making and leadership abilities, while teaching people to manage both success and failure. Today, it has become one of the most popular activities being organised at regular intervals. In it’s true sense, sports means \nmuch more than just to compete in a few events organised at certain intervals for the highest honour of one’s state/country. \nSports is a human activity that contributes to the holistic \ndevelopment of individuals. It is recognised as an individual activity which offers the opportunity for self-knowledge, self-expression and fulfilment of personal achievement; skill acquisition and demonstration of ability; enjoyment, good health and well-being. Sports also engages us in a collective effort to pursue human excellence. It provides us an opportunity for social interaction. It is a source of pleasure, but more than that, sports inspires, brings cultures together, and can bridge social divides. Sports can enrich society and foster friendships between nations. Sports is also responsible for the application of rules and for  adherence to values such as mutual respect, solidarity and fair play.\nSports today, faces the pressures of modern society and \nnew challenges. When sports events like Olympic games, Common-Wealth Games, Asian Games or those related to Cricket, Football, Volleyball, Tennis, Hockey or Badminton take place, millions of spectators, viewers on television, internet or listeners on radio become intensely engaged even though a selected few participate. \nSports is primarily a competitive activity where winning is \nthe be all and end all. Do you agree with this statement? Perhaps that is why, in this highly competitive sports environment, we quite often hear about unethical behaviour which includes cheating, bending the rules, doping, abuse of food additives, physical and verbal violence, harassment, sexual abuse and trafficking of young sportspersons, discrimination, exploitation, unequal opportunities, unethical sports practices, unfair Ethics in Sports 8\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n110 Health and Physical Education  — Class IX\nmeans, excessive commercialisation, use of drugs in sports \nand corruption.\nThese are just a few examples of what may go wrong with \nsports. There is not just one reason for these,  part of the problem is that people ignore ethics while making decisions. It is in this context that ethics occupy a critical place. In the present chapter we shall discuss various dimensions of sports ethics.  \n8.2 What Is sports EthIcs? \nBefore discussing various dimensions of sports ethics, it is important to understand the meaning of ethics.  Ethics, morals and values are used interchangeably in everyday language, though these terms are not synonyms. The concept of ethics is technically understood as a branch of philosophy that defines what is good for the individual and society and establishes the nature of obligations, or duties, that people owe themselves and to one another. But without going into the complexities of this concept, it is relevant to understand ethics as the practice of making principled choices between right and wrong: a code of conduct that guides human behaviour, a set of standards that guides our conduct. It is generally viewed as the system or set of rules, norms or laws by which attitudes and actions are determined to be either “right or wrong”. The fundamental problem of ethics is determining what constitutes proper conduct. It defines how individuals, professionals in different fields, organisations, associations, federation and corporations choose to interact with one another.  \nIn view of the above, sports ethics is a positive concept \nthat guides human action in sports. It is defined as the code of conduct for promoting and ensuring healthy sporting practices. Sports ethics signifies not just a certain form of behaviour but also a particular way of thinking. It promotes fair play among children and young persons via educational and preventive measures and encourages the dissemination of good practices to promote diversity in sport and combat all forms of discrimination. \nEvery child and young person has the right to play sport \nand games to gain satisfaction from the experience. The code of sports ethics applies to all levels of skills and commitment, recreational activities as well as competitive sport. It involves the elimination of all types of negative behaviour on and off the field. More importantly, it promotes equity and sporting excellence. \nSports ethics is also focused on equity in sport which should \nbe an expression of human excellence. It has two dimensions:\nBox 8.1\nBox 8.2Ethics is much more than playing within the rules, as it covers notions such as friendship, respect for others and the sporting spirit.\nInstitutions and \nadults must be the guarantors of the right to play sport and games.\nChapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd   110 18-11-2016   4:42:29 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nEthics in Sports  111\n (a) Institutional: Discrimination based on \ncriteria other than performance must be rejected, rules must \nbe applied uniformly \nand without resorting to arbitrary decisions; \n (b) Personal: There is a \nmoral obligation to \nabide by the rules, in accordance with the principles of fair play. It tries to ensure that sporting excellence must be an expression of human excellence and performance and results should emerge from the deserved and meritorious development of individual talent. The codes of sports ethics documented by the Olympic Committee and other international and national sports bodies, governments, sports federations and associations, sports sponsoring concerns and specialised research institutions provide a comprehensive view of sports ethics. These clearly suggest that sports ethics is a set of standards that guide the conduct of all concerned with sports — the sports persons, trainers, referees, managers, administrators, parents, teachers, journalists, doctors and pharmacists, nutritional expert, sports sponsoring concerns, top level sportspersons who serve as models and even spectators. These ethical standards are universal and objective and are not based on subjective guidelines. They have been proven over time. \n8.3 s ports EthIcs: standards\nWhat are sport ethics or standards? Commonly described as six pillars of fair play, Standards are integral elements of all sports activities, sports policy and management, and apply to all levels of ability and commitment, including recreational as well as competitive sports. These are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. \n8.3.1\n Trustworthiness\n•\t Always pursue victory with honour. \n•\t Demonstrate and demand integrity. \n•\t Observe and enforce the spirit and letter of the rules. \n•\t Do not engage in or tolerate dishonesty, \ncheating, or \ndishonourable conduct.  \n8.3.2  Respect\n•\t Treat the traditions of the sports and other participants \nwith respect. actIvIty  8.1\n•\tGather information from the literature on sports regarding the codes of sports ethics developed, documented and issued by various sports bodies at global and regional levels. \n•\tCollect such codes of sports ethics documented by government and sports bodies in India. \n•\tCompare the international and Indian codes of sports ethics.\nChapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd   111 18-11-2016   4:42:29 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n112 Health and Physical Education  — Class IX\n•\t Do not engage in or tolerate disrespectful conduct, \nincluding verbal abuse of opponents and officials, taunting and inappropriate celebrations. \n•\t\n Win with grace and lose with dignity. \n8.3.3  Responsibility\n•\t Be a positive role model on and off the field. \n•\t Safeguard your health. Know what you’re putting in your body. Just because a substance is legal or natural doesn’t mean it’s permitted or safe in health context. \n•\t\n Take responsibility and educate yourself about issues of anti-doping. It’s up to you to comply with anti-doping policies. \n8.3.4\n Fairness \n•\t Adhere to high standards of fair play. \n•\t Ensure that teams and athletes play by the rules and treat others fairly. \n•\t\n Anything that gives an unfair advantage \nviolates the \nspirit as well as the integrity of the sport.  \n8.3.5  Caring\n•\t Demonstrate concern for others. Never engage in careless behaviour that could injure yourself or others. \n•\t\n Help the team by encouraging your teammates. \n•\t Never tolerate unhealthy or dangerous conduct by your teammates. Encourage your teammates to make healthy choices and be prepared to report any dangerous behaviour. \n8.3.6\n Citizenship  \n•\t Play by the rules. Sports is defined by the rules. These \nrules may be yours or your team’s or your teacher’s. \n•\t Follow the spirit of the rules. Resist the temptation of gaining an advantage by bending the rules. Take pride in your performance while abiding by the rules. You have worked too hard to throw it away by cheating.   \n•\t\n As a member of a community, whether in a team, in a classroom, or with a family, think how your choices impact other community members. \n8.4 r EsponsIBIlIty  for oBsErvancE  of sports EthIcs  \nThe responsibility to ensure observance of sports ethics \nbelongs to all those who are directly or indirectly, associated with sports and especially those who influence and encourage the involvement and participation in sports.
