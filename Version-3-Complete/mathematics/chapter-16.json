This principle marks a departure\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\na gap between the school, home and community . The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also\nattempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in\nthe direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the national Policy on\nEducation (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not\nas receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThis aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’ s life at school a happy experience, rather then a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities\nrequiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCER T) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.\nWe wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,\nProfessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P . Sinclair of\nIGNOU, New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this\npossible. We are indebted to the institutions and or ganizations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially\ngrateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the\nDepartment of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource\nDevelopment under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G .P.\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an or ganisation committed to\nsystemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCER T\nwelcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision\nand refinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 December 2005 Research and Training\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nRATIONALISA TION OF CONTENT  IN THE T EXTBOOKS\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.\nThe National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and\nproviding opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this\nbackground, the NCER T has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks\nacross all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCER T across\nclasses have been taken into consideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n•Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class\n•Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n•Difficulty level\n•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from\nteachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning\n•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis pr esent edition, is a r eformatted version after car rying out the changes\ngiven above.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTEXTBOOK  DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE\nCHAIRPERSON , ADVISOR Y GROUP  IN SCIENCE  AND MATHEMA TICS\nJ.V.
