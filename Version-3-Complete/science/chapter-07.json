Atoms, molecules, planets, stars\nand galaxies ar e all in motion. W e often\nperceive an object to be in motion when its\nposition changes with time. However , ther e\nare situations wher e the motion is inferr ed\nthrough indir ect evidences. For example, we\ninfer the motion of air by observing the\nmovement of dust and the movement of leaves\nand branches of tr ees. What causes the\nphenomena of sunrise, sunset and changing\nof seasons? Is it due to the motion of the\nearth? If it is true, why don’t we dir ectly\nperceive the motion of the earth?\nAn object may appear to be moving for\none person and stationary for some other . For\nthe passengers in a moving bus, the r oadside\ntrees appear to be moving backwar ds. A\nperson standing on the r oad–side per ceives\nthe bus alongwith the passengers as moving.\nHowever , a passenger inside the bus sees his\nfellow passengers to be at r est. What do these\nobservations indicate?\nMost motions ar e complex. Some objects\nmay move in a straight line, others may take\na circular path. Some may r otate and a few\nothers may vibrate. Ther e may be situations\ninvolving a combination of these. In this\nchapter , we shall first lear n to describe the\nmotion of objects along a straight line. W e\nshall also lear n to expr ess such  motions\nthrough simple equations and graphs. Later ,\nwe shall discuss ways of describing\ncircular motion.Activity ______________ 7.1\n•Discuss whether the walls of your\nclassr\noom ar e at r est or in motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.2\n•Have you ever experienced that the\ntrain in which you ar e sitting appears\nto move while it is at r est?\n•Discuss and share your experience.\nThink and Act\nWe sometimes ar e endangered by the\nmotion of objects ar ound us, especially\nif that motion is erratic and\nuncontr olled as observed in a flooded\nriver, a hurricane or a tsunami. On the\nother hand, contr olled motion can be a\nservice to human beings such as in the\ngeneration of hydr o-electric power . Do\nyou feel the necessity to study the\nerratic motion of some objects and\nlearn to control them?\n7.1Describing Motion\nWe describe the location of an object by\nspecifying a r eference point. Let us\nunderstand this by an example. Let us\nassume that a school in a village is 2 km north\nof the railway station. W e have specified the\nposition of the school with r espect to the\nrailway station. In this example, the railway\nstation is the r eference point. W e could have\nalso chosen other r eference points accor ding\nto our convenience. Ther efore, to describe the\nposition of an object we need to specify a\nreference point called the origin.7\nMMM\nMMOTION OTIONOTION OTIONOTIONChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n7.1.1 MOTION  ALONG  A STRAIGHT  LINE\nThe simplest type of motion is the motion\nalong a straight line. W e shall first lear n to\ndescribe this by an example. Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its jour ney fr om O\nwhich is tr eated as its r eference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n•Take a metre scale and a long rope.\n•Walk fr om one cor ner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite cor ner along its\nsides.\n•Measur e the distance cover ed by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n•What dif ference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n•Automobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer . A\ncar is driven fr om Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The dif ference between the\nfinal r eading and the initial r eading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n•Find the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.The total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance cover ed by the object. T o\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the dir ection of\nmotion. Ther e are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. Fr om this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object fr om the initial\nposition O? This dif ference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject fr om O to C thr ough A. The shortest\ndistance measur ed from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A,  the distance\ncovered is 60 km  and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance coveredFig. 7.1:  Positions of an object on a straight line path= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further , we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zer o. However , the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km. Thus, two different physical\nquantities—the distance and the displacement,\nMOTION 73\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSCIENCE 74uestions\n1.An object has moved thr ough a\ndistance.

Let it travel 5 m in the first second,\n5 m mor e in the next second , 5 m in the\nthird second  and 5 m in the fourth second .\nIn this case, the object covers 5 m in each\nsecond. As the object covers equal distances\nin equal intervals of time, it is said to be in\nunifor m motion. The time interval in this\nmotion should be small. In our day-to-day\nlife, we come acr oss motions wher e objects\ncover unequal distances in equal intervals\nof time, for example, when a car is moving\non a cr owded str eet or a person is jogging\nin a park. These ar e some instances of\nnon-unifor m motion.\nActivity ______________ 7.5\n•The data regarding the motion of two\ndifferent objects A and B ar e given in\nTable 7.1.\n•Examine them car efully and state\nwhether the motion of the objects is\nunifor m or non-unifor m.Q\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.2Table 7.1\nTime Distance Distance\ntravelled by\ntravelled by\nobject A in m object  B in m\n9:30 am 10 12\n9:45 am 20 19\n10:00 am 30 23\n10:15 am 40 35\n10:30 am 50 37\n10:45 am 60 41\n11:00 am 70 44\n7.2Measuring the Rate of Motion\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nMOTION 75Look at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take dif ferent\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly.  The rate at which objects move can\nbe dif ferent. Also, dif fer\nent objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetr e per second (cm s–1) and kilometr e\nper hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we r equir e only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\nmotion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in ter ms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed = Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h–1. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1  An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 sAverage speed =  Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= 32 m\n6 s= 5.33 m s–1\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s–1.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be mor e\ncompr ehensive if we specify its dir ection of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite dir ection. The velocity of an object\ncan be unifor m or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object’s speed, dir ection of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity. It is\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\naverage speed.\nIn case the velocity of the object is\nchanging at a unifor m rate, then average\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\nperiod of time. That is,\naverage velocity = initialvelocity + finalvelocity\n2\nMathematically, v av  = u + v\n2(7.2)\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\nthat is, m s–1 or m/s.\nActivity ______________ 7.6\n•Measure the time it takes you to walk\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\nthe school.

In this case, the change in velocity\nof the object for any time interval is zero.\nHowever , in non-uniform motion, velocity\nvaries with time. I t has dif ferent values at\ndifferent instants and at dif ferent points of\nthe path. Thus, the change in velocity of the\nobject during any time interval is not zero.\nCan we now express the change in velocity\nof an object?Activity ActivityActivity ActivityActivity 7.7 7.77.7 7.77.7\n•At a time when it is cloudy, there may\nbe frequent thunder and lightning.

That is,\nacceleration  =change in velocity\ntime taken\nIf the velocity of an object changes from\nan initial value u to the final value v in time\nt, the acceleration a is,\nv – u\na =\nt(7.3)\nThis kind of motion is known as\naccelerated motion. The acceleration is taken\nto be positive if it is in the direction of velocity\nand negative when it is opposite to the\ndirection of velocity . The SI unit of\nacceleration is m s–2 .\nIf an object travels in a straight line and\nits velocity increases or decreases by equal\namounts in equal intervals of time, then the\nacceleration of the object is said to be\nuniform. The motion of a fre ely falling body\nis an example of uniformly accelerated\nmotion. On the other hand, an object can\ntravel with non-uniform acceleration if its\nvelocity changes at a non-uniform rate. F or\nexample, if a car travelling along a straight\nroad increases its spe ed by unequal amounts\nin equal intervals of time, then the car is said\nto be moving with non-uniform acceleration.\nActivity ActivityActivity ActivityActivity 7.8 7.87.8 7.87.8\n•In your everyday life you come across\na range of motions in which\n(a)acceleration is in the direction of\nmotion,\n(b)acceleration is against the\ndirection of motion,\n(c)acceleration is uniform,\n(d)acceleration is non-uniform.\n•Can you identify one example each\nfor the above type of motion?\nExampl ExamplExampl ExamplExampl eee ee 7.4 Starting from a stationary\nposition, Rahul paddles his bicycle toattain a velocity of 6 m s–1 in 30 s.

For example, in the telecast of a\none-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs\nshow the run rate of a team in each over . As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables.\nTo describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs. In this case, line graphs\nshow dependence of one physical quantity,\nsuch as distance or velocity, on another\nquantity, such as time.\n7.4.1 DISTANCE –TIME GRAPHS\nThe change in the position of an object with\ntime can be represented on the distance-time\ngraph adopting a convenient scale of choice.\nIn this graph, time is taken along the x–axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis.\nDistance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc.\nFig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith unifor m speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed. This shows that thedistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. N ote\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform spe ed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis.\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the spe ed of an object. T o do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x- axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B . These two\nlines me et each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, A\nC denotes\nthe time interval ( t2 – t1) while BC corresponds\nto the distance ( s2 – s1). We can se e from the\ngraph that as the object moves from the point\nA to B, it covers a distance ( s2 – s1) in time\n(t2 – t1). The spe ed, v of the object, therefore\ncan be represented as\n  = 2 1\n2 1–\n–s s\nt t(7.4)\nWe can also plot the distance-time graph\nfor accelerated motion.

Note that the\nshape of this graph is dif ferent fr om the earlier\ndistance-time graph (Fig. 7.3) for uniform\nmotion. The natur e of this graph shows non-\nlinear variation of the distance travelled by\nthe car with time. Thus, the graph shown in\nFig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform\nspeed.\n7.4.2 V ELOCITY -TIME GRAPHS\nThe variation in velocity with time for an object\nmoving in a straight line can be represented\nby a velocity-time graph. In this graph, time is\nrepresented along the x-\naxis and the velocityFig. 7.4: Distance-time graph for a car moving with\nnon-unifor m speed\nFig. 7.5: Velocity-time graph for unifor m motion\nof a caris represented along the y-axis. If the object\nmoves at uniform velocity, the height of its\nvelocity-time graph will not change with time\n(Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to\nthe x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time\ngraph for a car moving with uniform velocity\nof 40 km h–1.\nWe know that the pr oduct of velocity and\ntime give displacement of an object moving\nwith unifor m velocity. The ar\nea enclosed by\nvelocity-time graph and the time axis will be\nequal to the magnitude of the displacement.\nTo know the distance moved by the car\nbetween time  t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw\nperpendiculars fr om the points corr esponding\nto the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity\nof 40 km h–1 is repr esented by the height AC\nor BD and the time ( t2 – t1) is represented by\nthe length AB.\nSo, the distance s moved by the car in\ntime ( t2 – t1) can be expr essed as\ns=AC × CD\n=[(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h]\n=40 (t2– t1) km\n=area of the r ectangle ABDC (shaded\nin Fig. 7.5).\nWe can also study about unifor mly\naccelerated motion by plotting its velocity–\ntime graph. Consider a car being driven along\na straight r oad for testing its engine. Suppose\na person sitting next to the driver r ecords its\nvelocity after every 5 seconds by noting the\nreading of the speedometer of the car . The\nvelocity of the car , in km h–1 as well as in\nm s–1,  at dif ferent instants of time is shown\nin table 7.3.\nTable 7.3: Velocity of a car at\nregular instants of time\nTime Velocity of the car\n  (s) (m s–1) (km h–1)\n0 0 0\n5 2.5 9\n10 5.0 18\n15 7.5 27\n20 10.0 36\n25 12.5 45\n30 15.0 54\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nSCIENCE 80In this case, the velocity-time graph for the\nmotion of the car is shown in Fig. 7.6. The\nnature of the graph shows that velocity\nchanges by equal amounts in equal intervals\nof time. Thus, for all unifor mly accelerated\nmotion, the velocity-time graph is a\nstraight line.\nFig. 7.6:  Velocity-time graph for a car moving with\nuniform accelerations.\nYou can also deter mine the distance\nmoved by the car fr om its velocity-time graph.\nThe ar\nea under the velocity-time graph gives\nthe distance (magnitude of displacement)\nmoved by the car in a given interval of time.\nIf the car would have been moving with\nunifor m velocity, the distance travelled by it\nwould be r epresented by the ar ea ABCD\nunder the graph (Fig. 7.6).

For convenience, a\nset of three such equations are given below:\nv=u + at (7.5)\ns=ut + ½ at2(7.6)\n2 as = v2 – u2(7.7)\nwhere u is the initial velocity of the object which\nmoves with uniform acceleration a for time t,\nv is the final velocity, and s is the distance\ntravelled by the object in time t.

The change in\nthe velocity could be due to change in its\nmagnitude or the direction of the motion or\nboth. Can you think of an example when an\nobject does not change its magnitude of\nvelocity but only its direction of motion?straight parts AB, BC, CD and DA of the track.\nIn order to keep himself on track, he quickly\nchanges his speed at the corners. How many\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\nmotion four times.\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\nhave to change his direction six times while\nhe  completes one round. What if the track\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that\nas the number of sides of the track increases\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\nalong the circular path, the only change in\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\nexample of an accelerated moti on.\nWe know  that the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle\nof radius r is given by  π2 r. If the athlete takes\nt seconds to go once around the circular path\nof radius r, the speed v is given by\nπ2 rv =\nt\n(7.8)\nWhen an object moves in a circular path\nwith uniform speed, its motion is called\nuniform circular motion.(a) Rectangular track (b) Hexagonal track\n(d) A cir cular track (c) Octagonal shaped track\nFig. 7.8: The motion of an athlete along closed tracks\nof different shapes.\nLet us consider an example of the motion\nof a body along a closed path.

Let us assume that\nthe athlete runs at a uniform speed on the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nSCIENCE 84Activity ActivityActivity ActivityActivity 7.11 7.117.11 7.117.11\n•Take a piece of thread and tie a small\npiece of stone at one of its ends. Move\nthe stone to describe a circular path\nwith constant speed by holding the\nthread at the other end, as shown in\nFig. 7.9.If you carefully note, on being released\nthe stone moves along a straight line\ntangential to the circular path. This is\nbecause once the stone is released, it\ncontinues to move along the direction it has\nbeen moving at that instant. This shows that\nthe direction of motion changed at every point\nwhen the stone was moving along the circular\npath.\nWhen an athlete throws a hammer or a\ndiscus in a sports meet, he/she holds the\nhammer or the discus in his/her hand and\ngives it a circular motion by rotating his/\nher own body. Once released in the desired\ndirection, the hammer or discus moves in\nthe direction in which it was moving at the\ntime it was released, just like the piece of\nstone in the activity described above. There\nare many more familiar examples of objects\nmoving under uniform circular motion,\nsuch as the motion of the moon and the\nearth, a satellite in a circular orbit around\nthe earth, a cyclist on a circular track at\nconstant speed and so on.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n• Motion is a change of position; it can be described in terms\nof the distance moved or the displacement.\n• The motion of an object could be uniform or non-uniform\ndepending on whether its velocity is constant or changing.\n• The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time,\nand velocity is the displacement per unit time.\n• The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per\nunit time.\n• Uniform and non-uniform motions of objects can be shown\nthrough graphs.\n• The motion of an object moving at uniform acceleration can\nbe described with the help of the following equations, namely\nv = u + at\ns = ut + ½ at2\n2as = v2 – u2Fig. 7.9: A stone describing a circular path with\na velocity of constant magnitude.\n•Now, let the stone go by releasing the\nthread.\n•Can you tell the direction in which\nthe stone moves after it is released?\n•By repeating the activity for a few\ntimes and releasing the stone at\ndifferent positions of the circular\npath, check whether the direction in\nwhich the stone moves remains the\nsame or not.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nMOTION 85 8585 8585where u is initial velocity of the object, which moves with\nuniform acceleration  a for time t, v is its final velocity and\ns is the distance it travelled in time  t.\n• If an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed,\nits motion is called uniform circular motion.\nExercises\n1.An athlete completes one round of a circular track of\ndiameter 200 m in 40 s.
