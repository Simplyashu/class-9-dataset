But, for a scientist all these things\nare actually mixtures of different substances\nand hence not pure. For example, milk is\nactually a mixtur e of water , fat, pr oteins, etc.\nWhen a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pur e single for m of matter .\nAs we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water , minerals, soil, etc., ar e all mixtur es.\n2.1 What is a Mixture?\nMixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pur e form of matter . We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However , sodium chloride is itselfa pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents.\nSimilarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout.\nSoft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances. Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties.\nTherefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance.\n2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES\nDepending upon the nature of the components\nthat form a mixture, we can have different\ntypes of mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.1\n•Let us divide the class into groups A,\nB, C and D.\n•Group A takes a beaker containing\n50 mL of water and one spatula full\nof copper sulphate powder . Group B\ntakes 50 mL of water and two spatula\nfull of copper sulphate powder in a\nbeaker .\n•Groups C and D can take different\namounts of copper sulphate and\npotassium permanganate or common\nsalt (sodium chloride) and mix the\ngiven components to form a mixture.\n•Report the observations on the\nuniformity in colour and texture.\n•Groups A and B have obtained a\nmixture which has a uniform\ncomposition throughout. Such\nmixtures are called homogeneous\nmixtures or solutions. Some other\nexamples of such mixtures are: (i) salt\ndissolved in water and (ii) sugar\ndissolved in water . Compar e theHow do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter ,\nsalt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy\nfrom the market are pure?2\nIII\nIIS SSSS M  M M  M MATTER ATTERATTER ATTERATTER A  A A  A AROUND ROUNDROUND ROUNDROUND  U  U U  U US SS SS P  P P  P PURE UREURE UREURE? ?? ??Chapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nMore to  knowcolour of the solutions of the two\ngroups. Though both the groups have\nobtained copper sulphate solution but\nthe intensity of colour of the solutions\nis different. This shows that a\nhomogeneous mixture can have a\nvariable composition.\n•Groups C and D have obtained\nmixtures, which contain physically\ndistinct parts and have non-uniform\ncompositions. Such mixtures are called\nheterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of\nsodium chloride and iron filings, salt\nand sulphur , and oil and water ar e\nexamples of heterogeneous mixtures.\nActivity ______________ 2.2\n•Let us again divide the class into four\ngroups— A, B, C and D.\n•Distribute the following samples to\neach group:\n−Few crystals of copper sulphate\nto group A.\n−One spatula full of copper\nsulphate to group B.\n−Chalk powder or wheat flour to\ngroup C.\n−Few drops of milk or ink to\ngroup D.\n•Each group should add the given\nsample in water and stir properly\nusing a glass rod. Are the particles\nin the mixture visible?\n•Direct a beam of light from a torch\nthrough the beaker containing the\nmixtur e and observe fr om the fr ont. W as\nthe path of the beam of light visible?\n•Leave the mixtures undisturbed for\na few minutes (and set up the\nfiltration apparatus in the meantime).\nIs the mixture stable or do the\nparticles begin to settle after some\ntime?\n•Filter the mixture. Is there any\nresidue on the filter paper?\n•Discuss the results and form an\nopinion.\nGroups A and B have got a solution.\nGroup C has got a suspension.\nGroup D has got a colloidal solution.Now, we shall learn about solutions,\nsuspensions and colloidal solutions in the\nfollowing sections.\nuestions\n1.What is meant by a substance?\n2.List the points of differences\nbetween homogeneous and\nheterogeneous mixtures.\n2.2What is a Solution?\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture of two\nor mor e substances. Y ou come acr oss various\ntypes of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,\nsoda water , etc., ar e all examples of solutions.\nUsually we think of a solution as a liquid that\ncontains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved\nin it. But, we can also have solid solutions\n(alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a\nsolution there is homogeneity at the particle\nlevel. For example, lemonade tastes the same\nthroughout. This shows that particles of sugar\nor salt are evenly distributed in\nthe solution.Q\nFig. 2.2:  Filtration\nAlloys : Alloys are mixtures of two or\nmore metals or ametal and  a non-metal\nand cannot be separated into their\ncomponents by physical methods. But\nstill, an alloy is considered as a mixture\nbecause it shows the properties of its\nconstituents and can have variable\ncomposition. For example, brass is a\nmixture of approximately 30% zinc and\n70% copper .\nIS MATTER AROUND  US\n PURE? 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSCIENCE 16A solution has a solvent and a solute as its\ncomponents.  The component of the solution\nthat dissolves the other component in it\n(usually the component present in larger\namount) is called the solvent.  The component\nof the solution that is dissolved in the solvent\n(usually present in lesser quantity) is called\nthe solute.\nExamples:\n(i)A solution of sugar in water is a  solid\nin liquid solution. In this solution,\nsugar is the solute and water is\nthe solvent.\n(ii)A solution of iodine in alcohol known\nas ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid)\nas the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the\nsolvent.\n(iii)Aerated drinks like soda water , etc., ar e\ngas in liquid solutions. These contain\ncarbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water\n(liquid) as solvent.\n(iv)Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a\nhomogeneous mixture of a number of\ngases. Its two main constituents are:\noxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The\nother gases are present in very\nsmall quantities.\nProperties of a Solution\n•A solution is a homogeneous mixture.\n•The particles of a solution are smaller\nthan 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter . So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes.\n•Because of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution.\n•The solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed , that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 C ONCENTRATION  OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relativeproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called  dilute,\nconcentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n•Take approximately 50 mL of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n•Add salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n•When no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5oC.°\n•Start adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water  at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer fr\nom the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume) of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution .\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)Mass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= ×100\nMass of solution\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 17(ii)Mass by volume percentage of a solution\nMass of solute= ×100\nVolume of solution\n(iii)Volume by volume per centage of a\nsolution\nVolume of solute= ×100\nVolume of solution\nExample 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of\ncommon salt in 320 g of water . Calculate\nthe concentration in terms of mass by\nmass percentage of the solution.\nSolution:\nMass of solute (salt) =40 g\nMass of solvent (water) =320 g\nWe know,\nMass of solution = Mass of solute +\nMass of solvent\n= 40 g + 320 g\n= 360 g\nMass percentage of solution\nMass of solute= ×100\nMassof solution\n                 40= ×100 =11.1%\n360\n2.2.2 W HAT IS A SUSPENSION ?\nNon-homogeneous systems, like those\nobtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which\nsolids are dispersed in liquids, are called\nsuspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture in which the solute  particles do not\ndissolve but remain suspended throughout\nthe bulk of the medium. Particles of a\nsuspension are visible to the naked eye.\nProperties of a Suspension\n•Suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture.\n•The particles of a suspension can be seen\nby the naked eye.•The particles of a suspension scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•The solute particles settle down when a\nsuspension is left undisturbed, that is,\na suspension is unstable. They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS \nA COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.\nBecause of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.\nBut, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air .\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.(a) (b)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nSCIENCE 18 18181818Q•Colloids are big enough to scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•They do not settle down when left\nundisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite\nstable.\n•They cannot be separated from the\nmixture by the process of filtration. But,\na special technique of separation known\nas centrifugation can be used to\nseparate the colloidal particles.\nThe components of a colloidal solution are\nthe dispersed phase and the dispersion\nmedium. The solute-like component or the\ndispersed particles in a colloid form the\ndispersed phase, and the component in which\nthe dispersed phase is suspended is known\nas the dispersing medium. Colloids are\nclassified according to the state (solid, liquid\nor gas) of the dispersing medium and  the\ndispersed phase. A few common examples are\ngiven in Table 2.1. From this table you can\nsee that they are very common everyday life.Tyndall effect can be observed when\nsunlight passes through the canopy of a dense\nforest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets\nof water , which act as particles of colloid\ndispersed in air .\nFig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4:Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4:Fig. 2.4:  The Tyndall effect\nuestions\n1.Differentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples.\n2.How are sol, solution and suspension different from each other?\n3.To make a saturated solution,  36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water\nat 293 K.

The\nproperties that can be observed and specified\nlike colour , har dness, rigidity, fluidity,\ndensity, melting point, boiling point etc. are\nthe physical properites.\nThe interconversion of states is a physical\nchange because these changes occur without\na change in composition and no change in the\nchemical nature of the substance. Although\nice, water and water vapour all look different\nand display different physical properties, they\nare chemically the same.\nBoth water and cooking oil  are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different.\nThey dif fer in odour and inflammability. W e\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it dif ferent fr\nom water .\nBurning is a chemical change. During this\nprocess one substance reacts with another to\nundergo a change in chemical composition.\nChemical change brings change in the\nchemical properties of matter and we get new\nsubstances. A chemical change is also called\na chemical reaction.\nDuring burning of a candle, both physical\nand chemical changes take place. Can you\ndistinguish these?\nuestions\n1.Classify the following as chemical\nor physical changes:\n•cutting of trees,\n•melting of butter in a pan,\n•rusting of almirah,\n•boiling of water to form steam,\n•passing of electric current,\nthrough water and the water\nbreaking down into hydrogen\nand oxygen gases,\n•dissolving common salt in\nwater ,\n•making a fruit salad with raw\nfruits, andQ•burning of paper and wood.\n2.Try segr egating the things\naround you as pure substances\nor mixtures.\n2.4What are the Types of Pure\nSubstances?\nOn the basis of their chemical composition,\nsubstances can be classified either as elements\nor compounds.\n2.4.1 ELEMENTS\nRobert Boyle was the first scientist to use the\nterm element in 1661. Antoine Laurent\nLavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the\nfirst to establish an experimentally useful\ndefinition of an element. He defined an element\nas a basic form of matter that cannot be broken\ndown into simpler substances by chemical\nreactions.\nElements can be normally divided into\nmetals, non-metals and metalloids.\nMetals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•They have a lustre (shine).\n•They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour .\n•They conduct heat and electricity.\n•They are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires).\n•They are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets).\n•They are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit).\nExamples of metals ar e gold, silver ,\ncopper , iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mer cury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature.\nNon-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•They display a variety of colours.\n•They are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity.\n•They are not lustrous, sonorous\nor malleable.\nExamples of non-metals are hydrogen,\noxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nSCIENCE 20chlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate\nproperties between those of metals and non-\nmetals, they are  called metalloids; examples\nare boron, silicon, germanium, etc.\nMore to  know\n2.4.2 COMPOUNDS\nA compound is a substance composed of two\nor more elements, chemically combined with\none another in a fixed proportion.\nWhat do we get when two or more elements\nare combined?\nActivity ______________ 2.4\n•Divide the class into two groups. Give\n5 g of iron filings and 3 g of sulphur\npowder in a china dish to both\nthe groups.\nGroup I\n•Mix and crush iron filings and\nsulphur powder .\nGroup II\n•Mix and crush iron filings and\nsulphur powder . Heat this mixtur e\nstrongly till red hot. Remove from\nflame and let the mixture cool.\nGroups I and II\n•Check for magnetism in the material\nobtained. Bring a magnet near the\nmaterial and check if the material is\nattracted towards the magnet.•Compare the texture and colour of the\nmaterial obtained by the groups.\n•Add carbon disulphide to one part of\nthe  material obtained. Stir well\nand filter .\n•Add dilute sulphuric acid or dilute\nhydrochloric acid to the other part of\nthe material obtained. (Note: teacher\nsupervision is necessary for\nthis activity).\n•Perform all the above steps with both\nthe elements (iron and sulphur)\nseparately.\nNow answer\n•Did the material obtained by the two\ngroups look the same?\n•Which group has obtained a material\nwith magnetic properties?\n•Can we separate the components of the\nmaterial obtained?\n•On adding dilute sulphuric acid or\ndilute hydrochloric acid, did both the\ngroups obtain a gas? Did the gas in\nboth the cases smell the same\nor different?\nThe gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen,\nit is colourless, odourless and combustible– it\nis not advised to do the combustion test for\nhydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by\nGroup II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless\ngas with the smell of rotten eggs.\nYou must have observed that the pr oducts\nobtained by both the groups show different\nproperties, though the starting materials were\nthe same. Group I has carried out the activity\ninvolving a physical change whereas in case\nof Group II, a chemical change (a chemical\nreaction) has taken place.\n•The material obtained by group I is a\nmixture of the two substances. The\nsubstances given are the elements—iron\nand sulphur .\n•The properties of the mixture are the\nsame as that of its constituents.•The number of elements\nknown at present are more\nthan 100. Ninety-two elements\nare naturally occurring and the\nrest are man-made.\n•Majority of the elements are\nsolid.\n•Eleven elements are in gaseous\nstate at room temperature.\n•Two elements are liquid at\nroom temperature—mercury\nand bromine.\n•Elements, gallium and cesium\nbecome liquid at a temperature\nslightly above room\ntemperature (303 K).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 21•The material obtained by group II is a\ncompound.\n•On heating the two elements strongly we\nget a compound, which has totally\ndifferent properties compared to the\ncombining elements.•The composition of a compound is the\nsame thr oughout. W e can also observe\nthat the texture and the colour of the\ncompound are the same throughout.\nThus, we can summarise the physical\nand chemical nature of matter in the\nfollowing graphical organiser:Table 2.2: Mixtures and Compounds\nMixtures Compounds\n1.Elements or compounds just mix 1.Elements react to form new compounds.\ntogether to form a mixture and no\nnew compound is formed.\n2.A mixture has a variable composition. 2.The composition of each new substance\nis always fixed.\n3,A mixture shows the properties of the 3.The new substance has totally different\nconstituent substances. properties.\n4.The constituents can be seperated 4.The constituents can be separated only\nfairly easily by physical methods. by chemical or electrochemical\nreactions.\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n• A mixture contains more than one substance (element and/\nor compound) mixed in any proportion.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nSCIENCE 22Exercises\n1.

The major component of a solution is called the\nsolvent, and the minor , the solute.\n• The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present\nper unit volume or per unit mass of the solution.\n• Materials that are insoluble in a solvent and have particles\nthat are visible to naked eyes, form a suspension.\nA suspension is a heterogeneous mixture.\n• Colloids are heterogeneous mixtures in which the particle\nsize is too small to be seen with the naked eye, but is big\nenough to scatter light. Colloids are useful in industry and\ndaily life. The particles are called the dispersed phase and\nthe medium in which they are distributed is called the\ndispersion medium.\n• Pure substances can be elements or compounds. An element\nis a form of matter that cannot be broken down by chemical\nreactions into simpler substances. A compound is a substance\ncomposed of two or more different types of elements,\nchemically combined in a fixed proportion.\n• Properties of a compound are different from its constituent\nelements, whereas a mixture shows the properties of its\nconstituting elements or compounds.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 23(a) What mass of potassium nitrate would be needed to\nproduce a saturated solution of potassium nitrate in\n50 grams of water at 313 K?\n(b) Pragya makes a saturated solution of potassium chloride\nin water at 353 K and leaves the solution to cool at\nroom temperature.
