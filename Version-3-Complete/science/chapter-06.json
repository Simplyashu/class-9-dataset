For example, in Amoeba , a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour . Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue.\n6.1Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues?\nLet us compar e their structur e and functions.\nDo plants and animals have the same\nstructur e? Do they both per form similar\nfunctions?There are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they\ndon’t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\nAnimals on the other hand move around\nin sear ch of food, mates and shelter . They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\nAnother difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals.\nThe structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\nthese two major groups of organisms,\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\ndesign.\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.6\nT\nTT TTISSUES ISSUESISSUES ISSUESISSUESChapter\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nLateral meristemuestions\n1.What is a tissue?\n2.What is the utility of tissues in\nmulti-cellular organisms?\n6.2Plant Tissues\n6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE•From the above observations, answer\nthe following questions:\n1.Which of the two onions has longer\nroots? Why?\n2.Do the roots continue growing\neven after we have removed their\ntips?\n3.Why would the tips stop growing\nin jar 2 after we cut them?\nThe growth of plants occurs only in certain\nspecific regions. This is because the dividing\ntissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is\nlocated only at these points. Depending on\nthe r egion where they are pr esent,\nmeristematic tissues ar e classified as apical,\nlateral and inter calary (Fig. 6.2). New cells\nproduced by meristem are initially like those\nof meristem itself, but as they grow and\nmature, their characteristics slowly change and\nthey become differentiated as components of\nother tissues.\nFig. 6.1:  Growth of r oots in onion bulbs\nActivity ______________ 6.1\n•Take two glass jars and fill them with\nwater .\n•Now, take two onion bulbs and place\none on each jar , as shown in\nFig. 6.1.\n•Observe the growth of roots in both\nthe bulbs for a few days.\n•Measure the length of roots on day 1,\n2 and 3.\n•On day 4, cut the r oot tips of the onion\nbulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm. After this,\nobserve the gr owth of r oots in both the\njars and measur\ne their lengths each\nday for five mor e days and r ecord the\nobservations in tables, like the table\nbelow:\nLength Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5\nJar 1\nJar 2Q\nApical meristem is present at the growing\ntips of stems and roots and increases the\nlength of the stem and the root. The girth of\nthe stem or root increases due to lateral\nmeristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem\nseen in some plants is located near the node.Fig. 6.2:  Location of meristematic tissue in plant bodyJar 1 Jar 2\nTISSUES 61Apical meristem\nIntercalary meristem\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSCIENCE 62\nCuticle\nEpider mis\nCollenchyma\nParenchyma\nPhloem\nVascular bundleXylem\nFig. 6.3:  Section of a stemCells of meristematic tissue are very active,\nthey have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose walls\nand prominent nuclei. They lack vacuoles. Can\nwe think why they would lack vacuoles? (Y ou\nmight want to refer to the functions of vacuoles\nin the chapter on cells.)\n6.2.2 PERMANENT  TISSUE\nWhat happens to the cells formed by\nmeristematic tissue? They take up a specific\nrole and lose the ability to divide. As a r esult,\nthey for m a per manent tissue. This pr ocess\nof taking up a per manent shape, size, and  a\nfunction is called differentiation. Differentiation\nleads to the development of various types of\npermanent tissues.3.Can we think of reasons why there\nwould be so many types of cells?\n•We can also try to cut sections of plant\nroots. W e can even try cutting sections\nof root and stem of dif ferent plants.\n6.2.2 ( i) SIMPLE\n PERMANENT  TISSUE\nA few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are\ngenerally simple permanent tissue.\nParenchyma is the most common simple\npermanent tissue. It consists of relatively\nunspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They\nare living cells. They are usually loosely\narranged, thus large spaces between cells\n(intercellular  spaces) are found in this tissue\n(Fig. 6.4  a). This tissue generally stores food.\nActivity ______________ 6.2\n•Take a plant stem and  with the help\nof your teacher cut into very thin slices\nor sections.\n•Now, stain the slices with safranin.\nPlace one neatly cut section on a slide,\nand put a dr op of glycerine.\n•Cover with a cover -slip and observe\nunder a micr oscope. Observe the\nvarious types of cells and their\narrangement. Compare it with Fig. 6.3.\n•Now, answer the following on the\nbasis of your observation:\n1.Are all cells similar in structure?\n2.How many types of cells can\nbe seen?In some situations, it contains chlorophyll and\nperforms photosynthesis, and then it is called\nchlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air\ncavities are present in parenchyma to help\nthem float. Such a parenchyma type is called\naerenchyma.\nThe flexibility in plants is due to another\npermanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows\nbending of various parts of a plant  like tendrils\nand stems of climbers without breaking. It\nalso pr ovides mechanical support. W e can find\nthis tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.\nThe cells of this tissue are living, elongated\nand irregularly thickened at the\ncorners. There is very little intercellular space\n(Fig. 6.4 b).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nTISSUES 63Fig. 6.4: Various types of simple tissues: (a) Par enchyma (b) Collenchyma (c) Scler enchyma (i) transverse section,\n(ii) longitudinal section.\nYet another type of per manent tissue is\nsclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes the\nplant har d and stif f. We have seen the husk of\na coconut. It is made of sclerenchymatous\ntissue. The cells of this tissue are dead. They\nare long and narrow as the walls are thickened\ndue to lignin. Often these walls are so thick\nthat there is no internal space inside the cell\n(Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems,\naround vascular bundles, in the veins of leaves\nand in the hard covering of seeds and nuts. It\nprovides strength to the plant parts.\nActivity ______________ 6.3\n•Take a freshly plucked leaf of Rhoeo.\n•Stretch and break it by applying\npressure.\n•While breaking it, keep it stretched\ngently so that some peel or skin\nprojects out from the cut.\n•Remove this peel and put it in a petri\ndish filled with water .\n•Add a few drops of safranin.\n•Wait for a couple of minutes and then\ntransfer it onto a slide. Gently place\na cover slip over it.\n•Observe under microscope.\nWhat you observe is the outermost layer\nof cells, called epidermis. The epidermis is\nusually made of a single layer of cells. In some\nplants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis\nmay be thicker since protection against water\nloss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has\nan outer covering epidermis. It protects all the\nparts of the plant.

This aids\nin protection against loss of water , mechanical\ninjury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since\nit has a protective role to play, cells of\nepidermal  tissue form a continuous layer\nwithout intercellular spaces. Most epidermal\ncells are relatively flat. Often their outer and\nside walls are thicker than the inner wall.\nWe can observe small por es her e and\nthere in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores\nare called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are\nenclosed by two kidney-shaped cells\ncalled guard cells. They are necessary for\nexchanging gases with the atmosphere.\nTranspiration (loss of water in the for m of\nwater vapour) also takes place\nthrough stomata.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nSCIENCE 64Recall which gas is required for\nphotosynthesis.\nFind out the role of transpiration in plants.\nEpidermal cells of the roots, whose function\nis water absorption, commonly bear long hair -\nlike parts that greatly increase the total\nabsorptive surface area.\nIn some plants like desert plants,\nepider mis has a thick waxy coating of cutin\n(chemical substance with waterpr oof quality)\non its outer sur face. Can we think of a r eason\nfor this?\nIs the outer layer of a branch of a tr ee\ndifferent fr om the outer layer of a young stem?\nAs plants gr ow older , the outer pr otective\ntissue under goes certain changes. A strip of\nsecondary meristem located in the cortex forms\nlayers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells\nof cork are dead and compactly arranged\nwithout intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They\nalso have a substance called suberin in their\nwalls that makes them impervious to gases\nand water .is a distinctive feature of the complex plants,\none that has made possible their survival in\nthe terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing\na section of stem, can you see different types\nof cells in the vascular bundle?\nXylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem\nparenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres.\nTracheids and vessels have thick walls, and\nmany ar e dead cells when matur\ne. Tracheids\nand vessels are tubular structures. This allows\nthem to transport water and minerals\nvertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem\nfibres are mainly supportive in function.\nPhloem is made up of five types of cells:\nsieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells,\nphloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma\n[Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with\nperforated walls. Phloem transports food from\nleaves to other parts of the plant. Except\nphloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells.\n6.2.2 ( ii) COMPLEX  PERMANENT  TISSUE\nThe different types of tissues we have discussed\nuntil now are all made of one type of cells,\nwhich look like each other . Such tissues ar e\ncalled simple per manent tissue. Y et another\ntype of permanent tissue is complex tissue.\nComplex tissues are made of more than one\ntype of cells. All these cells coordinate to\nperform a common function. Xylem and\nphloem are examples of such complex tissues.\nThey are both conducting tissues and\nconstitute a vascular bundle.

How do these body\nparts move? For this we have specialised cells\ncalled muscle cells (Fig. 6.8). The contraction\nand relaxation of these cells result\nin movement.Q\nFig. 6.8:  Location of muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibres\nSmooth muscle fibre\n(Cell)NucleusDuring breathing we inhale oxygen. Where\ndoes this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs\nand then is transported to all the body cells\nthrough blood. Why would cells need oxygen?\nThe functions of mitochondria we studied\nearlier provide a clue to this question. Blood\nflows and carries various substances from one\npart of the body to the other . For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal.\nBlood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.\n6.3.1 EPITHELIAL  TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces.\nObviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body. Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane.\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nSCIENCE 66Fig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissuesof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear . Since they ar e arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium.\nWher e absorption and secr etion occur , as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n‘pillar -like’) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier . In the r espiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which ar e hair -like pr ojections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium.\nCuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium.\n6.3.2 CONNECTIVE  \nTISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue. Why would\nit be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue is\nprovided in the introduction of this chapter!\nNow, let us look at this type of tissue in some\nmore detail. The cells of connective tissue are\nloosely spaced and embedded in an\nintercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may\nbe jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature\nof matrix differs in concordance with the\nfunction of the particular connective tissue.\nActivity 6.4\nTake a drop of blood on a slide and\nobserve different cells present in it\nunder a microscope.of epithelium. This is called the simple\nsquamous epithelium (squama means scale\n(a) Squamous\n(b) Stratified squamous\n(c) Cuboidal\n(d) Columnar (Ciliated)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTISSUES 67Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called\nplasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs),\nwhite blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets\nare suspended. The plasma contains proteins,\nsalts and hormones. Blood flows and\ntransports gases, digested food, hor mones\nand waste materials to different parts of\nthe body.\nBone is another example of a connective\ntissue. It forms the framework that supports\nthe body. It also anchors the muscles and\nsupports the main or gans of the body. It is a\nstrong and nonflexible tissue (what would be\nthe advantage of these pr operties for bone\nfunctions?). Bone cells ar e embedded in a\nhard matrix that is composed of calcium and\nphosphorus compounds.\nTwo bones can be connected to each other\nby another type of connective tissue called the\nligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has\nconsiderable str ength. Ligaments contain\nvery little matrix and connect bones with\nbones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and\nare another type of connective tissue. Tendons\nare fibrous tissue with great strength but\nlimited flexibility.\nAnother type of connective tissue,\ncartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid\nmatrix is composed of pr\noteins and sugars.\nCartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints\nand is also present in the nose, ear , trachea\nand larynx. W e can fold the cartilage of the ears,\nbut we cannot bend the bones in our arms.\nThink of how  the two tissues are different!\nAreolar connective tissue is found between\nthe skin and muscles, ar ound blood vessels\nand nerves and in the bone marr ow. It fills\nthe space inside the or gans, supports inter nal\norgans and helps in r epair of tissues.\nWher e are fats stor ed in our body? Fat-\nstoring adipose tissue is found below the skin\nand between inter nal or gans. The cells of this\ntissue ar e filled with fat globules. Storage of\nfats also lets it act as an insulator .\n6.3.3 MUSCULAR  TISSUE\nMuscular tissue consists of elongated cells,\nalso called muscle fibres. This tissue is\nresponsible for movement in our body.Fig. 6.10:  Types of connective tissues: (a) types of blood\ncells, (b) compact bone, (c) hyaline cartilage,\n(d) areolar tissue, (e) adipose tissue\n(a)Different white\nblood corpusclesNeutrophil\n(polynuclear\nleucocyte)Basophil EosinophilNucleusCytoplasm\nLymphocyte Monocyte Platelets\nHaversian canal\n(contains blood vessels\nand nerve fibr es)\nCanaliculus (contains\nslender process of bone\ncell or osteocyte)Hyaline matrixChondrocyte\nRed blood\ncorpuscle(b)(c)\nReticular fibre Fibroblast\nMacrophage\nCollagen fibre\nMast cell Plasma cell\n(d)\nFat dropletNucleus\nAdipocyte\n(e)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nSCIENCE 68[Fig. 6.11(a)]. These muscles are also called\nskeletal muscles as they are mostly attached\nto bones and help in body movement. Under\nthe microscope, these muscles show alternate\nlight and dark bands or striations when\nstained appr opriately. As a r esult, they ar e\nalso called striated muscles. The cells of this\ntissue ar e long, cylindrical, unbranched and\nmultinucleate (having many nuclei).\nThe movement of food in the alimentary\ncanal or the contraction and relaxation of blood\nvessels ar e involuntary movements. W e cannot\nreally start them or stop them simply by\nwanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig.\n6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles contr ol such\nmovements. They ar e also found in the iris of\nthe eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the\nlungs. The cells are long with pointed ends\n(spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a\nsingle nucleus). They are also called unstriated\nmuscles – why would they be called that?\nThe muscles of the heart show rhythmic\ncontraction and relaxation throughout life.\nThese involuntary muscles are called cardiac\nmuscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are\ncylindrical, branched and uninucleate.\nActivity 6.5\nCompare the structures of different\ntypes of muscular tissues.

Many nerve fibres bound together by\nconnective tissue make up a nerve.\nThe signal that passes along the nerve fibre\nis called a nerve impulse. The nerve impulse\nfrom the nerve endings in transmitted to the\ndendrites of the next nerve cell. Nerve\nimpulses allow us to move our muscles when\nwe want to. The functional  combination of\nnerve and muscle tissue is fundamental to\nmost animals. This combination enables\nanimals to move rapidly in response to stimuli.\nuestions\n1.Name the tissue responsible for\nmovement in our body.\n2.What does a neuron look like?\n3.Give three features of cardiac\nmuscles.\n4.What are the functions of areolar\ntissue?Q\nNucleus\nDendrite\nAxonNerve ending\nCell body\nFig. 6.12: Fig. 6.12:Fig. 6.12: Fig. 6.12:Fig. 6.12:  Neuron—a unit of nervous tissuethen transmitting the stimulus very rapidly\nfrom one place to another within the body.
