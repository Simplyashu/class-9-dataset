Cork is  a substance\nwhich comes fr om the bark of a tr\nee. This\nwas in the year 1665 when Hooke made this\nchance observation thr ough a self-designed\nmicroscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes\ncells. Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little r oom’.\nThis may seem to be a very small and\ninsignificant incident but it is very important\nin the history of science. This was the very first\ntime that someone had observed that living\nthings appear to consist of separate units. The\nuse of the word ‘cell’ to describe these units is\nbeing used till this day in biology.\nLet us find out about cells.\n5.1What are Living Organisms\nMade Up of?\nActivity ______________ 5.1\n•Let us take a small piece fr om an onion\nbulb. W ith the help of a pair of for ceps,\nwe can peel of f the skin (called\nepider mis) fr om the concave side (inner\nlayer) of the onion. This layer can be\nput immediately in a watch-glass\ncontaining water . This will pr event the\npeel fr om getting folded or getting dry.\nWhat do we do with this peel?\n•Let us take a glass slide, put a dr op of\nwater on it and transfer a small piece\nof the peel fr om the watch glass to the\nslide. Make sur e that the peel is\nperfectly flat on the slide. A thin camel\nhair paintbrush might be necessary to\nhelp transfer the peel. Now we put a\ndrop of safranin solution on this piece\nfollowed by a cover slip. Take care toavoid air bubbles while putting the\ncover slip with the help of a mounting\nneedle. Ask your teacher for help. W e\nhave prepared a temporary mount of\nonion peel. W e can observe this slide\nunder low power followed by high\npowers of a compound microscope.\nFig. 5.1:  Compound microscope\nWhat do we observe as we look through\nthe lens?

On the other hand,\nmany cells gr oup together in a single body\nand assume dif ferent functions in it to for m\nvarious body parts in multicellular or ganisms\n(multi = many) such as some fungi, plants\nand animals. Can we find out names of some\nmore unicellular or ganisms?\nEvery multi-cellular or ganism has come\nfrom a single cell. How? Cells divide to\nproduce cells of their own kind. All cells thus\ncome fr om pr e-existing cells.\nActivity ______________ 5.2\n•We can try pr eparing temporary\nmounts of leaf peels, tip of r oots of\nonion or even peels of onions of dif ferent\nsizes.\n•After per forming the above activity, let\nus see what the answers to the following\nquestions would be:\n(a)Do all cells look alike in ter ms of\nshape and size?\n(b)Do all cells look alike in structur e?\n(c)Could we find dif ferences among\ncells from different parts of a\nplant body?\n(d)What similarities could we find?\nSome or ganisms can also have cells of\ndifferent kinds. Look at the following pictur e.\nIt depicts some cells fr om the human body.\nSpermBone\ncellSmooth\nmuscle\ncellBlood\ncells\nOvum\nFig. 5.3:\n Various cells fr om the human bodyMore to  knowWe can try pr eparing temporary mounts\nof peels of onions of dif ferent sizes. What do\nwe observe? Do we see similar structur es or\ndifferent structur es?\nWhat are these structures?\nThese structur es look similar to each other .\nTogether they for m a big structure like an\nonion bulb! W e find fr om this activity that\nonion bulbs of dif ferent sizes have similar\nsmall structures visible under a micr oscope.\nThe cells of the onion peel will all look the\nsame, r egardless of the size of the onion they\ncame from.\nThese small structures that we see ar e\nthe basic building units of the onion bulb.\nThese structur es ar e called cells. Not only\nonions, but all or ganisms that we observe\naround ar e made up of cells. However , ther e\nare also single cells that live on their own.\nCells wer e first discover ed by\nRobert Hooke  in 1665. He observed\nthe cells in a cork slice with the help\nof a primitive micr oscope.\nLeeuwenhoek (1674), with the\nimproved micr oscope, discover ed the\nfree living cells in pond water for the\nfirst time.  It was Robert Br own in\n1831 who discovered the nucleus in\nthe cell.   Purkinje in 1839 coined the\nterm ‘pr otoplasm’ for the fluid\nsubstance of the cell. The cell theory,\nthat all the plants and animals are\ncomposed of cells and that the cell is\nthe basic unit of life, was pr esented\nby two biologists, Schleiden (1838)\nand  Schwan n (1839). The cell theory\nwas further expanded by V irchow\n(1855) by suggesting  that all cells\narise  fr om pr e-existing cells.  W ith the\ndiscovery of the electr on micr oscope\nin 1940, it was possible to observe and\nunderstand the complex structur e of\nthe cell and its various or ganelles.\nThe invention of magnifying lenses led to\nthe discovery of the micr oscopic world. It is\nnow known that a single cell may constitute\na whole or ganism as in Amoeba,\nNerve Cell\nFat cell\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 51The shape and size of cells are related to\nthe specific function they per form. Some cells\nlike Amoeba\n have changing shapes. In some\ncases the cell shape could be mor e or less\nfixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell;\nfor example, nerve cells have a typical shape.\nEach living cell has the capacity to\nperform certain basic functions that ar e\ncharacteristic of all living for ms. How does\na living cell per form these basic functions?\nWe know that ther e is a division of labour in\nmulticellular or ganisms such as human\nbeings. This means that dif ferent parts of\nthe human body per form dif ferent functions.\nThe human body has a heart to pump blood,\na stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly,\ndivision of labour is also seen within a single\ncell. In fact, each such cell has got certain\nspecific components within it known as cell\norganelles. Each kind of cell or ganelle\nperforms a special function, such as making\nnew material in the cell, clearing up the\nwaste material fr om the cell and so on. A\ncell is able to live and per form all its\nfunctions because of these or ganelles. These\norganelles together constitute the basic unit\ncalled the cell. It is inter esting that all cells\nare found to have the same or ganelles, no\nmatter what their function is or what\norganism they ar e found in.\nuestions\n1.Who discovered cells, and how?\n2.Why is the cell called the\nstructural and functional unit of\nlife?\n5.2What is a Cell Made Up of?\nWhat is the Structural\nOrganisation of a Cell?\nWe saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called or ganelles. How is a cell\norganised?\nIf we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across thr ee featur es in almostevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its envir onment\nare possible due to these featur es. Let us see\nhow.\n5.2.1 PLASMA  MEMBRANE  OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outer most covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell fr om its\nexternal envir onment. The plasma membrane\nallows or per mits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials.\nThe cell membrane, ther efore, is called a\nselectively per meable membrane.\nHow does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell?\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move acr oss the cell membrane\nby a pr ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters.\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance fr om a r egion of high\nconcentration to a r egion wher e its\nconcentration is low.\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and r equir es to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s\nexter nal envir onment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compar ed to that inside the\ncell. As soon as ther e is a dif ference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, fr om a r egion of\nhigh concentration, to a r egion of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the pr ocess\nof dif fusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\nThus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its exter nal envir onment.\nWater also obeys the law of dif fusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nSCIENCE 52 52525252The movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration .\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following thr ee things could\nhappen:\n1.If the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.If the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.If the medium has a lower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water cr osses the cell\nmembrane in both dir ections, but this\ntime mor e water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Ther efore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of dif fusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:Activity ______________ 5.3\n(a)Remove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes.\nWhat do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is mor e concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n•Put dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. Y ou will\nobserve the following:\n(a)Each gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water .\n(b)However , when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater , and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water thr ough\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant r oots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, dif fusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition fr om its envir onment. Dif ferent\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport r equiring use\nof ener gy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of or ganic molecules called lipids\nand pr oteins. However , we can observe the\nstructur e of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electr\non micr oscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 53Activity ______________ 5.5\n•Find out about electron microscopes\nfrom resour ces in the school library or\nthrough the inter net. Discuss it with\nyour teacher .\nuestions\n1.How do substances like CO2 and\nwater move in and out of the cell?\nDiscuss.\n2.Why is the plasma membrane\ncalled a selectively per meable\nmembrane?\n5.2.2 CELL WALL\nPlant cells, in addition to the plasma\nmembrane, have another rigid outer covering\ncalled the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside\nthe plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is\nmainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a\ncomplex substance and provides structural\nstrength to plants.\nWhen a living plant cell loses water\nthrough osmosis ther e is shrinkage or\ncontraction of the contents of the cell away\nfrom the cell wall. This phenomenon is known\nas plasmolysis. W e can observe this\nphenomenon by per forming the following\nactivity:\nActivity ______________ 5.6\n•Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water\non a slide and examine cells under\nthe high power of a microscope. Note\nthe small green granules, called\nchlor oplasts. They contain a gr een\nsubstance called chlor ophyll. Put a\nstrong solution of sugar or salt on the\nmounted leaf on the slide. W ait for a\nminute and observe under a\nmicroscope. What do we see?\n•Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling\nwater for a few minutes. This kills the\ncells. Then mount one leaf on a slide\nand observe it under a microscope. Put\na strong solution of sugar or salt on\nthe mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for\na minute and observe it again. What\ndo we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?What do we infer from this activity? It\nappears that only living cells, and not dead\ncells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.\nCell walls per mit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) exter nal media without bursting.\nIn such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis. The cell swells, building up\npressur e against the cell wall. The wall exerts\nan equal pr essur e against the swollen cell.\nBecause of their walls, such cells can\nwithstand much gr eater changes in the\nsurrounding medium than animal cells.\n5.2.3 NUCLEUS\nRemember the temporary mount of onion peel\nwe pr epared? W e had put iodine solution on\nthe peel. Why? What would we see if we tried\nobserving the peel without putting the iodine\nsolution? T ry it and see what the dif ference\nis. Further , when we put iodine solution on\nthe peel, did each cell get evenly colour ed?\nAccording to their chemical composition\ndifferent r egions of cells get colour ed\ndifferentially. Some r egions appear darker\nthan other r egions. Apart fr om iodine solution\nwe could also use safranin solution or\nmethylene blue solution to stain the cells.\nWe have observed cells fr om an onion; let\nus now observe cells fr om our own body.\nActivity ______________ 5.7\n•Let us take a glass slide with a dr op of\nwater on it. Using an ice-cr eam spoon\ngently scrape the inside sur face of the\ncheek. Does any material get stuck on\nthe spoon? W ith the help of a needle\nwe can transfer this material and\nspread it evenly on the glass slide kept\nready for this. T o colour the material\nwe can put a dr op of methylene blue\nsolution on it. Now the material is r eady\nfor observation under micr oscope. Do\nnot forget to put a cover-slip on it!\n•What do we observe? What is the\nshape of the cells we see? Draw it on\nthe observation sheet.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nSCIENCE 54•Was ther e a darkly colour ed, spherical\nor oval, dot-like structure near the\ncentre of each cell? This structure is\ncalled nucleus. W ere ther e similar\nstructur es in onion peel cells?\nThe nucleus has a double layer ed covering\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\nmembrane has por es which allow the transfer\nof material fr om inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\nThe nucleus contains chr omosomes,\nwhich ar e visible as r od-shaped structur\nes\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\nChromosomes contain infor mation for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the for m of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chr omosomes ar e\ncomposed of DNA and pr otein. DNA molecules\ncontain the infor mation necessary for\nconstructing and or ganising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is pr esent as\npart of chr omatin material. Chromatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thr ead\nlike structur es. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chr omatin material gets or ganised\ninto chr omosomes.\nThe nucleus plays a central r ole in cellular\nreproduction, the pr ocess by which a single\ncell divides and for ms two new cells. It also\nplays a crucial part, along with the\nenvir onment, in deter mining the way the cell\nwill develop and what for m it will exhibit at\nmaturity, by dir ecting the chemical activities\nof the cell.\nIn some or ganisms like bacteria, the\nnuclear r egion of the cell may be poorly\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear r egion\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\nnucleoid. Such or ganisms, whose cells lack\na nuclear membrane, ar e called prokaryotes\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon\n= nucleus). Or ganisms with cells having a\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organellespresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\nfunctions of such organelles are also\nperformed by poorly or ganised parts of the\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlor ophyll\nin photosynthetic pr okaryotic bacteria is\nassociated with membranous vesicles (bag\nlike structur es) but not with plastids as in\neukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5).\nRibosomesPlasma\nmembrane\nCell wall\nNucleoid\nFig. 5.4:  Prokaryotic cell\n5.2.4 CYTOPLASM\nWhen we look at the temporary mounts of\nonion peel as well as human cheek cells, we\ncan see a lar ge region of each cell enclosed\nby the cell membrane. This r egion takes up\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\nspecialised cell or ganelles. Each of these\norganelles per forms a specific function for the\ncell.\nCell or ganelles ar e enclosed by\nmembranes. In pr okaryotes, beside the\nabsence of a defined nuclear r egion, the\nmembrane-bound cell or ganelles ar e also\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\nmembrane-enclosed or\nganelles.\nThe significance of membranes can be\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\na living body and use its cell machinery to\nmultiply.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 55uestion\n1.Fill in the gaps in the following\ntable illustrating dif ferences\nbetween pr okaryotic and\neukaryotic cells.\nProkaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell\n1.Size : generally 1.Size: generally\nsmall ( 1-10 µm) large ( 5-100 µm)\n1 µm = 10–6 m\n2.Nuclear r egion: 2.Nuclear r egion:\n_______________ well defined  and\n_______________ surrounded by a\nand known as__ nuclear membrane\n3.Chromosome: 3.More than one\nsingle chromosome\n4.Membrane-bound 4._______________\ncell or ganelles _______________\nabsent _______________\n5.2.5 CELL ORGANELLES\nEvery cell has a membrane ar ound it to keep\nits own contents separate fr om the exter nal\nenvir onment. Lar ge and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular or ganisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structur e and function. T o\nkeep these activities of dif ferent kinds\nseparate fr om each other , these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of\nthe featur es of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them fr om pr okaryotic cells. Some\nof these or ganelles ar e visible only with an\nelectr on microscope.\nWe have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell or ganelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic r eticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells.5.2.5 ( i) ENDOPLASMIC  RETICULUM  (ER)\nThe endoplasmic r eticulum (ER) is a lar ge\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or r ound or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structur e to the plasma membrane.\nThere are two types of ER– r ough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a\nmicroscope because it has particles called\nribosomes attached to its sur face. The\nribosomes, which ar e present in all active\ncells, ar e the sites of protein manufactur e.\nThe manufactur ed pr oteins ar e then sent to\nvarious places in the cell depending on need,\nusing the ER. The SER helps in the\nmanufactur e of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This pr ocess is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other pr oteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones. Although the ER varies greatly in\nappearance in different cells, it always forms a\nnetwork system.Q\nFig. 5.5:  Animal cell\nThus, one function of the ER is to serve as\nchannels for the transport of materials\n(especially pr\noteins) between various r egions\nof the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm\nand the nucleus. The ER also functions as a\ncytoplasmic framework providing a sur face\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nSCIENCE 56Camillo Golgi was born at\nCorteno near Brescia in\n1843. He studied\nmedicine at the University\nof Pavia. After graduating\nin 1865, he continued to\nwork in Pavia at the\nHospital of St. Matteo. At\nthat time most of his\ninvestigations were\nconcerned with the nervous system, In 1872\nhe accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer\nat the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at\nAbbiategrasso.  He first started his\ninvestigations into the nervous system in a\nlittle kitchen of this hospital, which he had\nconverted into a laboratory. However , the\nwork of greatest importance, which Golgi\ncarried out was a revolutionary method of\nstaining individual nerve and cell structures.\nThis method is referred to as the ‘black\nreaction’. This method uses a weak solution\nof silver nitrate and is particularly valuable\nin tracing the processes and most delicate\nramifications of cells.  All through his life,\nhe continued to work on these lines,\nmodifying and improving this technique.\nGolgi received the highest honours and\nawards in recognition of his work. He shared\nthe Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago\nRamony  Cajal for their work on the structure\nof the nervous system.\n5.2.5 ( iii) LYSOSOMES\nStructurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound\nsacs filled with digestive enzymes. These\nenzymes ar e made by RER. L ysosomes ar\ne a\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\norganelles. Foreign materials entering the cell,\nsuch as bacteria or food, as well as old\norganelles end up in the lysosomes, which\nbreak complex substances into simpler\nsubstances. L ysosomes are able to do this\nbecause they contain powerful digestive\nenzymes capable of breaking down all organic\nmaterial. During the disturbance in cellular\nmetabolism,  for example, when the cell getsFig. 5.6:  Plant cell\nfor some of the biochemical activities of the\ncell. In the liver cells of the group of animals\ncalled vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays\na crucial role in detoxifying many poisons\nand drugs.\n5.2.5 ( ii) GOLGI APPARATUS\nThe Golgi apparatus, first described by\nCamillo Golgi, consists of a system of\nmembrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs)\narranged approximately parallel to each other\nin stacks called cisterns. These membranes\noften have connections with the membranes\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\npackaged and dispatched to various tar gets\ninside and outside the cell thr ough the Golgi\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\nmodification and packaging of pr oducts in\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\n5.2.5 (iii)].\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL  UNIT OF LIFE 57 57575757damaged, lysosomes may burst and the\nenzymes digest their own cell. Therefore,\nlysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’\nof a cell.\n5.2.5 ( iv) MITOCHONDRIA\nMitochondria are known as the powerhouses\nof the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules.\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work.\nMitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins.\n5.2.5 ( V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids – chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\nThe internal organisation of the Ch loroplast\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\nare similar to mitochondria in external\nstructure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also\nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n5.2.5 ( vi) VACUOLES\nVacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid\ncontents. V acuoles are small sized in animal\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles .\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\nMany substances of importance in the life of\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\norganisms like Amoeba , the food vacuole\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba  has\nconsumed. In some unicellular organisms,\nspecialised vacuoles also play important roles\nin expelling excess water and some wastes\nfrom the cell.\nuestions\n1.Can you name the two organelles\nwe have studied that contain\ntheir own genetic material?\n2.If the organisation of a cell is\ndestroyed due to some physical\nor chemical influence, what will\nhappen?\n3.Why are lysosomes known as\nsuicide bags?\n4.Where are proteins synthesised\ninside the cell?\nEach cell thus acquires its structure and\nability to function because of the organisation\nof its membrane and organelles in specific\nways. The cell thus has a basic structural\norganisation. This helps the cells to perform\nfunctions like respiration, obtaining nutrition,\nand clearing of waste material, or forming\nnew proteins.\nThus, the cell is the fundamental structural\nunit of living organisms. It is also the basic\nfunctional unit of life.\nCell DivisionCell DivisionCell DivisionCell DivisionCell Division\nNew cells are formed in organisms in order to\ngrow, to replace old, dead and injured cells,\nand to form gametes required for\nreproduction. The process by which new cells\nare made is called cell division. There are two\nmain types of cell division: mitosis\nand meiosis.\nThe process of cell division by which most\nof the cells divide for growth is called mitosis.\nIn this process, each cell called mother cellQ\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nSCIENCE 58 5858 5858\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n· The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell.\n· Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids\nand proteins.\n· The cell membrane is an active part of the cell. It regulates\nthe movement of materials between the ordered interior of\nthe cell and the outer environment.\n· In plant cells, a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is\nlocated outside the cell membrane.\n· The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants,\nfungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without\nbursting.\n· The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm\nby double-layered membrane and it directs the life processes\nof the cell.\n· The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular\ntransport and as a manufacturing surface.\n· The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound\nvesicles that function in the storage, modification and\npackaging of substances manufactured in the cell.\n· Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called\nplastids, which are of two types—chromoplasts and\nleucoplasts.Fig. 5.7: Fig. 5.7:Fig. 5.7: Fig. 5.7:Fig. 5.7:  Mitosis Fig. 5.8: Fig. 5.8:Fig. 5.8: Fig. 5.8:Fig. 5.8:  Meiosis\ndivides to form two identical daughter cells\n(Fig. 5.7). The daughter cells have the same\nnumber of chromosomes as mother cell. It\nhelps in growth and repair of tissues\nin organisms.\nSpecific cells of reproductive organs or tissues\nin animals and plants divide to form gametes,\nwhich after fertilisation give rise to offspring.They divide by a different process called\nmeiosis which involves two consecutive\ndivisions. When a cell divides by meiosis it\nproduces four new cells instead of just two (Fig.\n5.8). The new cells only have half the number\nof chromosomes than that of the mother cells.\nCan you think as to why the chromosome\nnumber has reduced to half in daughter cells?Chromosomes\nMother cellMother cellDaughter\ncells\nDaughtercellsMeiosis-IMeiosis-II\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nTHE FUNDAMENT AL UNIT OF LIFE 59• Chromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts\nand they perform photosynthesis.\n• The primary function of leucoplasts is storage.\n• Most mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that\nhelps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores\nimportant substances including wastes.\n• Prokaryotic cells have no membrane-bound organelles, their\nchromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid, and they\nhave only very small ribosomes as organelles.\n• Cells in organisms divide for growth of body, for repalcing\ndead cells, and for forming gametes for reproduction.\nExercises\n1.Make a comparison and write down ways in which plant\ncells are different from animal cells.\n2.How is a prokaryotic cell different from a eukaryotic cell?\n3.What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or\nbreaks down?\n4.What would happen to the life of a cell if there was no Golgi\napparatus?\n5.Which organelle is known as the powerhouse of the cell? Why?\n6.Where do the lipids and proteins constituting the cell\nmembrane get synthesised?\n7.How does an Amoeba  obtain its food?\n8.What is osmosis?\n9.Carry out the following osmosis experiment:\nTake four peeled potato halves and scoos each one out to\nmake potato cups. One of these potato cups should be\nmade from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough\ncontaining water . Now,•\n(a)Keep cup A empty\n(b)Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B\n(c)Put one teaspoon salt in cup C\n(d)Put one teaspoon sugar in the boiled potato cup D.\nKeep these for two hours. Then observe the four potato\ncups and answer the following:\n(i)Explain why water gathers in the hollowed portion of\nB and C.\n(ii)Why is potato A necessary for this experiment?\n(iii)Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed\nout portions of A and D.\n10. Which type of cell division is required for growth and repair\nof body and which type is involved in formation of gametes?\nReprint 2025-26\n",
