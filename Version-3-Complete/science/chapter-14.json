This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape\nour system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The\nsyllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-\ncentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nspace to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development team responsible\nfor this book. W e wish to thank the Chair man of the advisory gr oup in science\nand mathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProfessor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School of Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru\nUniversity, New Delhi, for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\ncontributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to them and\ntheir principals for making this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions\nand organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their\nresour ces, material and personnel. W e are especially grateful to the members\nof the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary\nand Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the\nChair manship of Pr\nofessor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P . Deshpande, for their\nvaluable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic\nreform and continuous impr ovement in the quality of its pr oducts, NCER T\nwelcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further\nrevision and refinement.\nDirector\nNew Delhi  National Council of Educational\n20 December 2005 Resear ch and T raining\n(iv)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nRATIONALISATION  OF CONTENT  IN THE T EXTBOOK\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on\nstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the\ncontent load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative\nmindset. In this backdr op, the NCER T has undertaken the exer cise to rationalise\nthe textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the\nNCER T acr oss classes have been taken into consideration in this exer cise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n•Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the\nsame class\n•Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n•Difficulty level\n•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or\npeer-learning\n•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes\ngiven above.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nReprint 2025-26\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTEXTBOOK  DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE\nCHAIRMAN , ADVISORY  GROUP FOR TEXTBOOKS  \nIN SCIENCE  AND MATHEMATICS\nJ.V.
